<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>Aristotle and other ancient writers regarded comets as
meteors generated in the atmosphere. This opinion was
generally accepted, even by the learned, until the observations
of Tycho, near the close of the sixteenth century,
showed those mysterious objects to be more distant than
the moon, thus raising them to the dignity of <i>celestial</i>
bodies. An achievement somewhat similar, and certainly
no less interesting, was reserved for the astronomers of the
<i>nineteenth</i> century. This was the great discovery that
<i>shooting-stars, fire-balls, and meteoric stones, are, like
comets, cosmical bodies moving in conic sections about the
sun</i>. <span class="smcap">Dr. Halley</span> was the first to foretell the return of a
comet, and the year 1759 will ever be known in history as
that which witnessed the fulfillment of his prophecy. But
in the department of <i>meteoric</i> astronomy, a similar honor
must now be awarded to the late <span class="smcap">Dr. Olbers</span>. Soon after
the great star-shower of 1833 he inferred from a comparison
of recorded facts that the November display attains a maximum
at intervals of thirty-three or thirty-four years. He
accordingly designated 1866 or 1867 as the time of its
probable return; and the night of November 13th of the
former year must always be memorable as affording the
first verification of <i>his</i> prediction. On that night several
thousand meteors were observed in one hour from a single
station. This remarkable display, together with the fact
that another still more brilliant is looked for in November,
1867, has given meteoric astronomy a more than ordinary
degree of interest in the public mind. To gratify, in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>
measure, the curiosity which has been awakened, by presenting
in a popular form the principal results of observation
and study in this new field of research, is the main
design of the following work.</p>

<p>The first two chapters contain a popular view of what is
known in regard to the star-showers of August and November,
and also of some other epochs. The third is a description,
in chronological order, of the most important falls of
meteoric stones, together with the phenomena attending
their descent. The fourth and following chapters to the
eleventh inclusive, discuss various questions in the theory
of meteors: such, for instance, as the relative number of
aerolitic falls during different parts of the day, and also of
the year; the coexistence of the different forms of meteoric
matter in the same rings; meteoric dust; the stability of
the solar system; the doctrine of a resisting medium; the
extent of the atmosphere as indicated by meteors; the meteoric
theory of solar heat; and the phenomena of variable
and temporary stars. The twelfth chapter regards the
rings of Saturn as dense meteoric swarms, and accounts for
the principal interval between them. The thirteenth presents
various facts, not previously noticed, respecting the
asteroid zone between Mars and Jupiter, with suggestions
concerning their cause or explanation.</p>

<p>As the nebular hypothesis furnishes a plausible account
of the origin of meteoric streams, it seemed desirable to present
an intelligible view of that celebrated theory. This
accordingly forms the subject of the closing chapter.</p>

<p>The greater part of the following treatise, it is proper to
remark, was written before the publication (in England) of
Dr. Phipson's volume on "Meteors, Aerolites, and Falling-stars."
The author has had that work before him, however,
while completing his manuscript, and has availed himself
of some of the accounts there given of recent phenomena.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">A GENERAL VIEW OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The Solar System</span> consists of the sun, together with
the planets and comets which revolve around him as the
center of their motions. The sun is the great controlling
orb of this system, and the source of light and heat to its
various members. Its magnitude is one million four hundred
thousand times greater than that of the earth, and it
contains more than seven hundred times as much matter
as all the planets put together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mercury</span> is the nearest planet to the sun; its mean distance
being about thirty-seven millions of miles. Its diameter
is about three thousand miles, and it completes its
orbital revolution in 88 days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Venus</span>, the next member of the system, is sometimes our
morning and sometimes our evening star. Its magnitude
is almost exactly the same as that of the earth. It revolves
round the sun in 225 days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Earth</span> is the third planet from the sun in the order
of distance; the radius of its orbit being about ninety-five
millions of miles. It is attended by one satellite&mdash;the moon&mdash;the
diameter of which is 2160 miles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mars</span> is the first planet exterior to the earth's orbit. It
is considerably smaller than the earth, and has no satellite.
It revolves round the sun in 687 days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
<span class="smcap">The Asteroids.</span>&mdash;Since the commencement of the
present century a remarkable zone of telescopic planets has
been discovered immediately exterior to the orbit of Mars.
These bodies are extremely small; some of them probably
containing less matter than the largest mountains on the
earth's surface. More than ninety members of the group
are known at present, and the number is annually increasing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jupiter</span>, the first planet exterior to the asteroids, is
nearly five hundred millions of miles from the sun, and revolves
round him in a little less than twelve years. This
planet is ninety thousand miles in diameter and contains
more than twice as much matter as all the other planets,
primary and secondary, put together. Jupiter is attended
by four moons or satellites.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saturn</span> is the seventh planet in the order of distance&mdash;counting
the asteroids as one. Its orbit is about four hundred
millions of miles beyond that of Jupiter. This planet
is attended by eight satellites, and is surrounded by three
broad, flat rings. Saturn is seventy-six thousand miles in
diameter, and its mass or quantity of matter is more than
twice that of all the other planets except Jupiter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uranus</span> is at double the distance of Saturn, or nineteen
times that of the earth. Its diameter is about thirty-five
thousand miles, and its period of revolution, eighty-four
years. It is attended by four satellites.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neptune</span> is the most remote known member of the system;
its distance being nearly three thousand millions of
miles. It is somewhat larger than Uranus; has certainly
one satellite, and probably several more. Its period is
about one hundred and sixty-five years. A cannon-ball
flying at the rate of five hundred miles per hour would not
reach the orbit of Neptune from the sun in less than six
hundred and eighty years.</p>

<p>These planets all move round the sun in the same direction&mdash;from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
west to east. Their motions are nearly circular,
and also nearly in the same plane. Their orbits, except
that of Neptune, are represented in the frontispiece. It is
proper to remark, however, that all representations of the
solar system by maps and planetariums must give an exceedingly
erroneous view either of the magnitudes or distances
of its various members. If the earth, for instance,
be denoted by a ball half an inch in diameter, the diameter
of the sun, according to the same scale (sixteen thousand
miles to the inch), will be between four and five feet; that
of the earth's orbit, about one thousand feet; while that of
Neptune's orbit will be nearly six miles. To give an accurate
representation of the solar system at a single view is
therefore plainly impracticable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Comets.</span>&mdash;The number of comets belonging to our system
is unknown. The appearance of more than seven hundred
has been recorded, and of this number, the elements of
about two hundred have been computed. They move in
very eccentric orbits&mdash;some, perhaps, in parabolas or hyperbolas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Zodiacal Light</span> is a term first applied by Dominic
Cassini, in 1683, to a faint nebulous aurora, somewhat resembling
the milky-way, apparently of a conical or lenticular
form, having its base toward the sun, and its axis nearly
in the direction of the ecliptic. The most favorable time
for observing it is when its axis is most nearly perpendicular
to the horizon. This, in our latitudes, occurs in March
for the evening, and in October for the morning. The angular
distance of its vertex from the sun is frequently seventy
or eighty degrees, while sometimes, though rarely (except
within the tropics), it exceeds even one hundred degrees.</p>

<p>The zodiacal light is probably identical with the meteor
called <i>trabes</i> by <i>Pliny</i> and <i>Seneca</i>. It was noticed in the
latter part of the sixteenth century by Tycho Brahé, who
"considered it to be an abnormal spring-evening twilight."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
It was described by Descartes about the year 1630, and
again by Childrey in 1661. The first accurate description
of the phenomenon was given, however, by Cassini. This
astronomer supposed the appearance to be produced by the
blended light of an innumerable multitude of extremely
small planetary bodies revolving in a ring about the sun.
The appearance of the phenomenon as seen in this country
is represented in Fig. 2.</p>

<p>For general readers it may not be improper to premise
the following explanations:</p>

<p>Meteors are of two kinds, <i>cosmical</i> and <i>terrestrial</i>: the
former traverse the interplanetary spaces; the latter originate
in the earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p><i>Bolides</i> is a general name for meteoric fire-balls of
greater magnitude than shooting-stars.</p>

<p>The <i>period</i> of a planet, comet, or meteor is the time
which it occupies in completing one orbital revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
The motion of a heavenly body is said to be <i>direct</i> when
it is from west to east; and <i>retrograde</i> when it is from
east to west.</p>

<p><i>Encke's Hypothesis of a Resisting Medium.</i>&mdash;The time
occupied by Encke's comet in completing its revolution
about the sun is becoming less and less at each successive
return. Professor Encke explains this fact by supposing
the interplanetary spaces to be filled with an extremely
rare fluid, the resistance of which to the cometary motion
produces the observed contraction of the orbit.</p>

<span class="subhead notbold">SHOOTING-STARS.</span></h2>

<h3>I. The Meteors of November 12th&ndash;14th.</h3>

<p>Although shooting-stars have doubtless been
observed in all ages of the world, they have never,
until recently, attracted the special attention of
scientific men. The first exact observations of the
phenomena were undertaken, about the close of the
last century, by Messrs. Brandes and Benzenberg.
The importance, however, of this new department
of research was not generally recognized till after
the brilliant meteoric display of November 13th, 1833.
This shower of fire can never be forgotten by those
who witnessed <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> The display was observed from
the West Indies to British America, and from 60°
to 100° west longitude from Greenwich. Captain
Hammond, of the ship Restitution, had just arrived
at Salem, Massachusetts, where he observed the
phenomenon from midnight till daylight. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
noticed with astonishment that precisely one year
before, viz., on the 13th of November, 1832, he had
observed a similar appearance (although the meteors
were less numerous) at Mocha, in Arabia. It was
soon found, moreover, as a further and most remarkable
coincidence, that an extraordinary fall of meteors
had been witnessed on the 12th of November, 1799.
This was seen and described by Andrew Ellicott,
Esq., who was then at sea near Cape Florida. It
was also observed in Cumana, South America, by
Humboldt, who states that it was "simultaneously
seen in the new continent, from the equator to New
Herrnhut, in Greenland (lat. 64° 14&prime;), and between
46° and 82° longitude."</p>

<p>This wonderful correspondence of dates excited a
very lively interest throughout the scientific world.
It was inferred that a recurrence of the phenomenon
might be expected, and accordingly arrangements
were made for systematic observations on the 12th,
13th, and 14th of November. The periodicity of
the shower was thus, in a very short time, placed
wholly beyond question. The examination of old
historical records led to the discovery of at least 12
appearances of the November shower previous to
the great fall of 1833. The descriptions of these
phenomena will be found collected in an interesting
article by Prof. H.&nbsp;A. Newton, in the <i>American Journal
of Science and Arts</i>, for May, 1864. They occurred
in the years 902, 931, 934, 1002, 1101, 1202, 1366,
1533, 1602, 1698, 1799, and 1832. Besides these 12
enumerated by Professor Newton as "the predecessors
of the great exhibition on the morning of November
13th, 1833," we find 6 others, less distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
marked, in the catalogue of M. <span class="locked">Quetelet.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> These
were in the years 1787, 1818, 1822, 1823, 1828, and
1831. From 1883 to 1849, inclusive, Quetelet's
catalogue indicates 11 partial returns of the November
shower; making in all, up to the latter date, 29.
In 1835, November 13th, a straw roof was set on fire
by a meteoric fire-ball, in the department de l'Aine,
France. On the 12th of November, 1837, "at 8
o'clock in the evening, the attention of observers in
various parts of Great Britain was directed to a
bright luminous body, apparently proceeding from
the North, which, after making a rapid descent, in
the manner of a rocket, suddenly burst, and scattering
its particles into various beautiful forms, vanished
in the atmosphere. This was succeeded by others
all similar to the first, both in shape and the manner
of its ultimate disappearance. The whole display
terminated at ten o'clock, when dark clouds, which
continued up till a late hour, overspread the earth,
preventing any further observations."&mdash;<i>Milner's Gallery
of Nature</i>, p. 142.</p>

<p>In 1838, November 12th&ndash;13th, meteors were
observed in unusual numbers at Vienna. One of
extraordinary brilliancy, having an apparent magnitude
equal to that of the full moon, was seen near
Cherburg.</p>

<p>On several other returns of the November epoch
the number of meteors observed has been greater
than on ordinary nights; the distinctly marked
exhibitions, however, up to 1866, have all been
enumerated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<h3 class="notbold"><span class="smcap">The Shower of November 14, 1866.</span></h3>

<p>The fact that all great displays of the November
meteors have taken place at intervals of thirty-three
or thirty-four years, or some multiple of that period,
had led to a general expectation of a brilliant shower
in 1866. In this country, however, the public curiosity
was much disappointed. The numbers seen
were greater than on ordinary nights, but not such
as would have attracted any special attention. The
greatest number recorded at any one station was seen
at New Haven, by Prof. Newton. On the night of
the 12th, 694 were counted in five hours and twenty
minutes, and on the following night, 881 in five
hours. This was about six times the ordinary number.
A more brilliant display was, however, witnessed
in Europe. Meteors began to appear in
unusual frequency about eleven o'clock on the night
of the 13th, and continued to increase with great
rapidity for more than two hours; the maximum
being reached a little after one o'clock. The Edinburgh
<i>Scotsman</i>, of November 14th, contains a highly
interesting description of the phenomenon as observed
at that city. "Standing on the Calton Hill,
and looking westward," the editor remarks,&mdash;"with
the Observatory shutting out the lights of Prince's
Street&mdash;it was easy for the eye to delude the imagination
into fancying some distant enemy bombarding
Edinburgh Castle from long range; and the occasional
cessation of the shower for a few seconds, only
to break out again with more numerous and more
brilliant drops of fire, served to countenance this
fancy. Again, turning eastward, it was possible now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
and then to catch broken glimpses of the train of
one of the meteors through the grim dark pillars of
that ruin of most successful manufacture, the National
Monument; and in fact from no point in or
out of the city was it possible to watch the strange
rain of stars, pervading as it did all points of the
heavens, without pleased interest, and a kindling of
the imagination, and often a touch of deeper feeling
that bordered on awe. The spectacle, of which the
loftiest and most elaborate description could but be
at the best imperfect&mdash;which truly should have been
seen to be imagined&mdash;will not soon pass from the
memories of those to whose minds were last night
presented the mysterious activities and boundless
fecundities of that universe of the heavens, the very
unchangeableness of whose beauty has to many made
it monotonous and of no interest."</p>

<p>The appearance of the phenomenon, as witnessed
at London, is minutely described in the <i>Times</i> of
November 15th. The shower occurred chiefly between
the hours of twelve and two. About one
o'clock a single observer counted 200 in two minutes.
The whole number seen at Greenwich was
8485. The shower was also observed in different
countries on the continent.</p>

<h4><i>The Meteors of 1866 compared with those of former
Displays.</i></h4>

<p>The star shower of 1866 was much inferior to those
of 1799 and <span class="locked">1833.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> With these exceptions, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
it has, perhaps, been scarcely surpassed during the
last 500 years. Historians represent the meteors of
902 as innumerable, and as moving like rain in all
possible <span class="locked">directions.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> The exhibition of 1202 was
no less magnificent. The stars, it is said, were seen
to dash against each other like swarms of locusts;
the phenomenon lasting till <span class="locked">daybreak.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> The shower
of 1366 is thus described in a Portuguese chronicle,
quoted by Humboldt: "In the year 1366, twenty-two
days of the month of October being past, three
months before the death of the king, Dom Pedro
(of Portugal), there was in the heavens a movement
of stars, such as men never before saw or heard of.
At midnight, and for some time after, all the stars
moved from the east to the west; and after being
collected together, they began to move, some in one
direction, and others in another. And afterward
they fell from the sky in such numbers, and so thickly
together, that as they descended low in the air, they
seemed large and fiery, and the sky and the air
seemed to be in flames, and even the earth appeared
as if ready to take fire. That portion of the sky
where there were no stars, seemed to be divided
into many parts, and this lasted for a long time."</p>

<p>The following is Humboldt's description of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
shower of 1799, as witnessed by himself and Bonpland,
in Cumana, South America: "From half
after two, the most extraordinary luminous meteors
were seen toward the east.... Thousands of bolides
and falling stars succeeded each other during four
hours. They filled a space in the sky extending from
the true east 30° toward the north and south. In an
amplitude of 60° the meteors were seen to rise above
the horizon at E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. and at E., describe arcs more
or less extended, and fall toward the south, after
having followed the direction of the meridian. Some
of them attained a height of 40°, and all exceeded
25° or 30°.... Mr. Bonpland relates, that from the
beginning of the phenomenon there was not a space
in the firmament equal in extent to three diameters
of the moon, that was not filled at every instant with
bolides and falling-stars.... The Guaiqueries in
the Indian suburb came out and asserted that the
firework had begun at one o'clock.... The phenomenon
ceased by degrees after four o'clock, and
the bolides and falling-stars became less frequent;
but we still distinguished some toward the northeast
a quarter of an hour after sunrise."</p>

<h3 class="notbold"><span class="smcap">Discussion of the Phenomena.</span></h3>

<p>Since the memorable display of November 13th,
1833, the phenomena of shooting-stars have been
observed and discussed by Brandes, Benzenberg,
Olbers, Saigey, Heis, Olmsted, Herrick, Twining,
Newton, Greg, and many others. In the elaborate
paper of Professor Olmsted, it was shown that the
meteors had their origin at a distance of more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
2000 miles from the earth's surface; that their paths
diverged from a common point near the star <i>Gamma
Leonis</i>; that in a number of instances they became
visible about 80 miles from the earth's surface; that
their velocity was comparable to that of the earth in
its orbit; and that in some cases their extinction
occurred at an elevation of 30 miles. It was inferred,
moreover, that they consisted of combustible
matter which took fire and was consumed in passing
through the atmosphere; that this matter was derived
from a nebulous body revolving round the sun
in an elliptical orbit, but little inclined to the plane
of the ecliptic; that its aphelion was near that point
of the earth's orbit through which we annually pass
about the 13th of November&mdash;the perihelion being
a little within the orbit of Mercury; and finally that
its period was about one-half that of the earth. Dr.
Olmsted subsequently modified his theory, having
been led by further observations to regard the zodiacal
light as the nebulous body from which the
shooting-stars are derived. The latter hypothesis
was also adopted by the celebrated Biot.</p>

<p>The fact that the position of the radiant point does
not change with the earth's rotation, places the cosmical
origin of the meteors wholly beyond question.
The theory of a closed ring of nebulous matter revolving
round the sun in an elliptical orbit which
intersects that of the earth, affords a simple and
satisfactory explanation of the phenomena. This
theory was adopted by Humboldt, Arago, and others,
shortly after the occurrence of the meteoric shower
of 1833. That the body which furnishes the material
of these meteors moves in a closed or elliptical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
orbit is evident from the periodicity of the shower. It
is also manifest from the partial recurrence of the phenomenon
from year to year, that the matter is diffused
around the orbit; while the extraordinary falls
of 1833, 1799, 1366, and 1202, prove the diffusion to
be far from uniform.</p>

<h3 class="notbold"><span class="smcap">Elements of the Orbit.</span></h3>

<p>Future observations, it may be hoped, will ultimately
lead to an accurate determination of the
elements of this ring: many years, however, will
probably elapse before all the circumstances of its
motion can be satisfactorily known. Professor Newton,
of Yale College, has led the way in an able discussion
of the <span class="locked">observations.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> He has shown that
the different parts of the ring are, in all probability,
of very unequal density; that the motion is retrograde;
and that the time, during which the meteors
complete a revolution about the sun, must be limited
to one of five accurately determined periods, viz.:
180·05 days, 185·54 days, 354·62 days, 376·5 days, or
33·25 years. He makes the inclination of the ring to
the ecliptic about 17°. The five periods specified, he
remarks, "are not all equally probable. Some of the
members of the group which visited us last November
[1863] gave us the means of locating approximately
the central point of the region from which the paths
diverge. Mr. G.&nbsp;A. Nolen has, by graphical processes
specially devised for the purpose, found its longitude
to be 142°, and its latitude 8° 30&prime;. This longitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
is very nearly that of the point in the ecliptic toward
which the earth is moving. Hence the point from
which the absolute motion of the bodies is directed
(being in a great circle through the other two points)
has the same longitude. The absolute motion of
each meteor, then, is directed very nearly at right
angles to a line from it to the sun, the deviation being
probably not more than two or three degrees.</p>

<p>"Now, if in one year the group make 2 ± 1/33·25 revolutions,
there is only a small portion of the orbit near
the aphelion which fulfills the above condition. In
like manner, if the periodic time is 33·25 years, only
a small portion of the orbit near the perihelion fulfills
it. On the other hand, if the annual motion is
1 ± 1/33·25 revolutions, the required condition is answered
through a large part of the orbit. Inasmuch as no
reason appears why the earth should meet a group
near its apsides rather than elsewhere, we must regard
it as more probable that the group makes in one
year either 1 + 1/33·25, or 1 - 1/33·25 revolutions."</p>

<p>Professor Newton concludes that the third of the
above-mentioned periods, viz., 354·62 days, combines
the greatest amount of probability of being the true
one. We grant the force of the reasons assigned for
its adoption. At least one consideration, however,
in favor of the long period of 33·25 years is by no
means destitute of weight: of nearly 100 known
bodies which revolve about the sun in orbits of small
eccentricity, not one has a retrograde motion. Now
if this striking fact has resulted from a general cause,
how shall we account for the backward motion of a
meteoric ring, in an orbit almost circular, and but
little inclined to the plane of the ecliptic? In such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
a case, is not the preponderance of probability in
favor of the longer period?</p>

<p>A revolution in 33·25 years corresponds to an
ellipse whose major axis is 20·6. Consequently the
aphelion distance would be somewhat greater than
the mean distance of Uranus. It may also be worthy
of note, that five periods of the ring would be very
nearly equal to two of Uranus.</p>

<p>The <i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
Society</i> for December, 1866, and January, 1867, contain
numerous articles on the star shower of November
13th&ndash;14th, 1866. Sir John Herschel carefully
observed the phenomena, and his conclusions in
regard to the orbit are confirmatory of those of Professor
Newton. "We are constrained to conclude,"
he remarks, "that the true line of direction, in space
of each meteor's flight, lay in a plane at right angles
to the earth's radius vector at the moment; and that
therefore, except in the improbable assumption that
the meteor was at that moment <i>in perihelio</i> or <i>in aphelio</i>,
its orbit would not deviate greatly from the
circular form." The question is one to be decided
by observation, and the only meteor whose track
and time of flight seem to have been well observed,
is that described by Professor Newton in <i>Silliman's
Journal</i> for January, 1867, p. 86. The velocity in
this case, if the estimated time of flight was nearly
correct, was <i>inconsistent with the theory of a circular
orbit</i>.</p>

<p>It is also worthy of notice that Dr. Oppolzer's
elements of the first comet of 1866 resemble, in a
remarkable manner, those of the meteoric ring, supposing
the latter to have a period of about 33¼ years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Schiaparelli's elements of the November ring, and
Oppolzer's elements of the comet of 1866, are as
follows:</p>

<p>It seems very improbable that these coincidences
should be accidental. Leverrier and other astronomers
have found elements of the meteoric orbit agreeing
closely with those given by Schiaparelli. Should
the identity of the orbits be fully confirmed, it will
follow that the comet of 1866 <i>is a very large meteor</i> of
the November stream.</p>

<p>The researches of Professor C. Bruhns, of Leipzig,
in regard to this group of meteors afford a probable
explanation of the division of Biela's comet&mdash;a phenomenon
which has greatly perplexed astronomers
for the last twenty years. Adopting the period of
33¼ years, Professor Bruhns finds that the comet
passed extremely near, and probably <i>through</i> the meteoric
ring near the last of December, 1845. It is
easy to perceive that such a collision might produce
the separation soon afterward observed.</p>

<p>As the comet of Biela makes three revolutions in
twenty years, it was again at this intersection, or
approximate intersection of orbits about the end of
1865. But although the comet's position, with respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
to the earth, was the same as in 1845&ndash;6, and
although astronomers watched eagerly for its appearance,
their search was unsuccessful. In short,
<i>the comet is lost</i>. The denser portion of the meteoric
stream was then approaching its perihelion. A portion
of the arc had even passed that point, as a
meteoric shower was observed at Greenwich on the
13th of November, <span class="locked">1865.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> The motion of the meteoric
stream is retrograde; that of the comet, direct.
Did the latter plunge into the former, and was its
non appearance the result of such collision and entanglement?</p>

<span class="subhead notbold">OTHER METEORIC RINGS.</span></h2>

<h3>II. The Meteors of August 6th&ndash;11th.</h3>

<p>Muschenbroek, in his <i>Introduction to Natural Philosophy</i>,
published in 1762, called attention to the fact
that shooting-stars are more abundant in August
than in any other part of the year. The annual
periodicity of the maximum on the 9th or 10th of
the month was first shown, however, by Quetelet,
shortly after the discovery of the yearly return of
the November phenomenon. Since that time an extraordinary
number of meteors has been regularly
observed, both in Europe and America, from the
7th to the 11th of the month; the greatest number
being generally seen on the 10th. In 1839, Edward
Heis, of Aix-la-Chapelle, saw 160 meteors in one
hour on the night of the 10th. In 1842, he saw 34
in ten minutes at the time of the maximum. In
1861, on the night of the 10th, four observers, watching
together at New Haven, saw in three hours&mdash;from
ten to one o'clock&mdash;289 meteors. On the same
night, at Natick, Massachusetts, two observers saw
397 in about seven hours. At London, Mercer
County, Pennsylvania, on the night of August 9th,
1866, Samuel S. Gilson, Esq., watching alone, saw
72 meteors in forty minutes, and, with an assistant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
117 in one hour and fifteen minutes. Generally, the
number observed per hour, at the time of the August
maximum, is about nine times as great as on
ordinary nights. Like the November meteors, they
have a common "radiant;" that is, their tracks,
when produced backward, meet, or nearly meet, in
a particular point in the constellation Perseus.</p>

<p>Of the 315 meteoric displays given in Quetelet's
"Catalogue des principales apparitions d'étoiles filantes,"
63 seem to have been derived from the August
ring. The first 11 of these, with one exception,
were observed in China during the last days of July,
as follows:</p>

<p class="in0">The next dates are 1243, August 2d, and 1451,
August 7th. A comparison of these dates indicates
a forward motion of the node of the ring along the
ecliptic. This was pointed out several years since
by Boguslawski. A similar motion of the node has
also been found in the case of the November ring.
That these points should be stationary is, indeed, altogether
improbable. The nodes of all the planetary
orbits, it is well known, have a secular variation.</p>

<p>On the evening of August 10th, 1861, at about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
11h. 30m., a meteor was seen by Mr. E.&nbsp;C. Herrick
and Prof. A.&nbsp;C. Twining, at New Haven, Connecticut,
which "was much more splendid than Venus, and left
a train of sparks which remained luminous for twenty
seconds after the meteor disappeared." The same
meteor was also accurately observed at Burlington,
New Jersey, by Mr. Benjamin V. Marsh. It was
"conformable,"&mdash;that is, its track produced backward
passed through the common radiant&mdash;and it
was undoubtedly a member of the August group.
The observations were discussed by Professor H.&nbsp;A.
Newton, of Yale College, who deduced from them
the following approximate elements of the <span class="locked">ring:<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span></p>

<p>The earth moving at the rate of 68,000 miles per
hour, is at least five days in passing entirely through
the ring. This gives a thickness of more than
8,000,000 miles.</p>

<p>The result of Professor Newton's researches on
the orbit of this ring, though undertaken with inadequate
data, and hence, in some respects, probably
far from correct, is nevertheless highly interesting
as being the first attempt to determine the orbit
of shooting-stars. More recent investigations have
shown a remarkable resemblance between the elements
of these meteors and those of the third comet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
of 1862. The former, by Schiaparelli, and the latter,

<p>This similarity is too great to be accidental. <i>The

<p>The display of 401 was witnessed in China, and
is described as "very remarkable." That of 1803
was best observed in Virginia, and was at its maximum
between one and three o'clock. The alarm of
fire had called many of the inhabitants of Richmond
from their houses, so that the phenomenon was generally
witnessed. The meteors "seemed to fall from
every point in the heavens, in such numbers as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
resemble a shower of sky-rockets." Some were of
extraordinary magnitude. "One in particular, appeared
to fall from the zenith, of the apparent size of
a ball 18 inches in diameter, that lighted the whole
hemisphere for several seconds."</p>

<p>The probability that the meteoric falls about the
20th of April are derived from a ring which intersects
the earth's orbit, was first suggested by Arago,
in 1836. The preceding list indicates a forward
motion of the node. The radiant, according to Mr.
Greg, is about <i>Corona</i>. The number of meteors
observed in 1838, 1841, and 1850, was not very extraordinary.
Recent observations indicate April
9th&ndash;12th as another epoch. The radiant is in Virgo.</p>

<h3>IV. The Meteors of December 6th&ndash;13th.</h3>

<p>On the 13th of December, 1795, a large meteoric
stone fell in England. On the night, between the
6th and 7th of December, 1798, Professor Brandes,
then a student in Göttingen, saw 2000 shooting-stars.
On the 11th of the month, 1836, a fall of meteoric
stones, described by Humboldt as "enormous," occurred
near the village of Macao, in Brazil. During
the last few years unusual numbers of shooting-stars
have been noticed by different observers from the
10th to the 13th; the maximum occurring about the
11th. From <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 848, December 2d, to 1847, December
8th&ndash;10th, we find 14 star showers in Quetelet's
catalogue, derived, probably, from this meteoric
stream. As in other cases, the dates seem to show
a progressive motion of the node. The position of
the radiant, as determined by Benjamin V. Marsh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Esq., of Philadelphia, from observations in 1861 and
1862, and also by R.&nbsp;P. Greg, Esq., of Manchester,
England, is at a point midway between Castor and
Pollux.</p>

<h3>V. The Meteors of January 2d&ndash;3d.</h3>

<p>About the middle of the present century, Mr.
Julius Schmidt, of Bonn, a distinguished and accurate
observer, designated the 2d of January as a
meteoric epoch; characterizing it, however, as "probably
somewhat doubtful." Recent observations, especially
those of R.&nbsp;P. Greg, Esq., have fully confirmed
it. The meteors for several hours are said to be as
numerous as at the August maximum. The radiant
is near the star <i>Beta</i> of the constellation Böotes.</p>

<p>Quetelet's list contains at least five exhibitions
which belong to this epoch. Two or three others
may also be referred to it with more or less probability.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Several other meteoric epochs have been indicated;
some of which, however, must yet be regarded as
doubtful. In thirty years, from 1809 to 1839, 12 falls
of bolides and meteoric stones occurred from the 27th
to the 29th of November. Such coincidences can
hardly be accidental. Unusual numbers of shooting-stars
have also been seen about the 27th of July; from
the 15th to the 19th of October, and about the middle
of February. The radiant, for the last-mentioned
epoch, is in <i>Leo Minor</i>. The numbers observed in
October are said to be at present increasing. At least
seven of the exhibitions in Quetelet's catalogue are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
referable to this epoch. It is worthy of remark,
moreover, that three of the dates specified by Mr.
Greg as <i>aerolite</i> epochs are coincident with those of
shooting-stars; viz., February 15th&ndash;19th, July 26th,
and December 13th. The whole number of exhibitions
enumerated in Quetelet's catalogue is 315.
In eighty-two instances the day of the month on
which the phenomenon occurred is not specified.
Nearly two-thirds of the remainder, as we have seen,
belong to established epochs, and the periodicity of
others will perhaps yet be discovered. But reasons
are not wanting for believing that our system is
traversed by numerous meteoric streams besides
those which actually intersect the earth's orbit.
The asteroid region between Mars and Jupiter is
probably occupied by such an annulus. The number
of these asteroids increases as their magnitudes
diminish; and this doubtless continues to be the
case far below the limit of telescopic discovery. The
zodiacal light is probably a dense meteoric ring, or
rather, perhaps, a number of rings. We speak of it
as <i>dense</i> in comparison with others, which are invisible
except by the ignition of their particles in passing
through the atmosphere. From a discussion of the
motions of the perihelia of Mercury and Mars, Leverrier
has inferred the existence of two rings of
minute asteroids; one within the orbit of Mercury,
whose mass is nearly equal to that of Mercury himself;
the other at the mean distance of the earth,
whose mass cannot <i>exceed</i> the tenth part of the mass
of the earth.</p>

<p>Within the last few years a distinguished European
savant, Buys-Ballot, of Utrecht, has discovered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
short period of variation in the amount of solar heat
received by the earth: the time from one maximum to
another exceeding the period of the sun's apparent
rotation by about twelve hours. The variation cannot
therefore be due to any inequality in the heating
power of the different portions of the sun's surface.
The discoverer has suggested that it may be produced
by a meteoric ring, whose period slightly exceeds
that of the sun's rotation. Such a zone might
influence our temperature by partially intercepting
the solar heat.</p>

<h3 class="notbold"><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span></h3>

<p>1. The average number of shooting-stars seen in
a clear, moonless night by a single observer, is about
8 per hour. <i>One</i> observer, however, sees only about
one-fourth of those visible from his point of observation.
About 30 per hour might therefore be seen
by watching the entire hemisphere. In other words,
720 shooting-stars per day could be seen by the naked
eye at any one point of the earth's surface, did the
sun, moon, and clouds permit.</p>

<p>2. The mean altitude of shooting-stars above the
earth's surface is about 60 miles.</p>

<p>3. The number visible over the whole earth is
about 10,460 times the number to be seen at any one
point. Hence the average number of those daily
entering the atmosphere and having sufficient
magnitude to be seen by the naked eye, is about
7,532,600.</p>

<p>4. The observations of Pape and Winnecke indicate
that the number of meteors visible through the
telescope, employed by the latter, is about 53 times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
the number visible to the naked eye, or about
400,000,000 per <span class="locked">day.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> This is two per day, or 73,000
per century, for every square mile of the earth's surface.
By increasing the optical power, this number
would probably be indefinitely increased. At special
times, moreover, such as the epochs of the great
meteoric showers, the addition of foreign matter to
our atmosphere is much greater than ordinary. It
becomes, therefore, an interesting question whether
sensible changes may not thus be produced in the
atmosphere of our planet.</p>

<p>5. In August, 1863, 20 shooting-stars were doubly
observed in England; that is, they were seen at two
different stations. The average weight of these meteors,
estimated&mdash;in accordance with the mechanical
theory of heat&mdash;from the quantity of light emitted,
was a little more than two ounces.</p>

<p>6. A meteoric mass exterior to the atmosphere,
and consequently non-luminous, was observed on
the evening of October 4th, 1864, by Edward Heis,
a distinguished European astronomer. It entered the
field of view as he was observing the milky way, and
he was enabled to follow it over 11 or 12 degrees of
its path. It eclipsed, while in view, a number of the
fixed stars.</p>

<span class="subhead notbold">AEROLITES.</span></h2>

<p>It is now well known that much greater variety
obtains in the structure of the solar system than was
formerly supposed. This is true, not only in regard
to the magnitudes and densities of the bodies composing
it, but also in respect to the forms of their
orbits. The whole number of planets, primary and
secondary, known to the immortal author of the
<i>Mecanique Celeste</i>, was only 29. This number has
been more than quadrupled in the last quarter of a
century. In Laplace's view, moreover, all comets
were strangers within the solar domain, having entered
it from without. It is now believed that a
large proportion originated in the system and belong
properly to it.</p>

such bodies as differ but little from those given, is
presented at one view in the following table:</p>

<p>The diminution doubtless continues indefinitely below
the present limit of optical power. If, however,
the orbits have small eccentricity, such asteroids
could not become known to us unless their mean distances

<p>Were the eccentricities of the nearest asteroids equal
to that of Faye's comet, they would in perihelion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
intersect the earth's orbit. Now, in the case of both
asteroids and comets, the smallest are the most
numerous; and as this doubtless continues below
the limit of telescopic discovery, the earth ought to
encounter such bodies in its annual motion. <i>It
actually does so.</i> The number of <i>cometoids</i> thus encountered
in the form of <i>meteoric stones</i>, <i>fire-balls</i>, and
<i>shooting-stars</i> in the course of a single year amounts
to many millions. The extremely minute, and such
as consist of matter in the gaseous form, are consumed
or dissipated in the upper regions of the atmosphere.
No deposit from ordinary shooting-stars
has ever been known to reach the earth's surface.
But there is probably great variety in the physical
constitution of the bodies encountered; and though
comparatively few contain a sufficient amount of
matter in the solid form to reach the surface of our
planet, scarcely a year passes without the fall of
meteoric stones in some part of the earth, either
singly or in clusters. Now, when we consider how
small a proportion of the whole number are probably
observed, it is obvious that the actual occurrence
of the phenomenon can be by no means <span class="locked">rare.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span></p>

<p>Although numerous instances of the fall of aerolites
had been recorded, some of them apparently
well authenticated, the occurrence long appeared too
marvelous and improbable to gain credence with
scientific men. Such a shower of rocky fragments
occurred, however, on the 26th of April, 1803, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
L'Aigle, in France, as forever to dissipate all doubt
on the subject. At one o'clock <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, the heavens
being almost cloudless, a tremendous noise, like that
of thunder, was heard, and at the same time an immense
fire-ball was seen moving with great rapidity
through the atmosphere. This was followed by a
violent explosion which lasted several minutes, and
which was heard not only at L'Aigle, but in every
direction around it to the distance of seventy miles.
Immediately after a great number of meteoric stones
fell to the earth, generally penetrating to some distance
beneath the surface. The largest of these
fragments weighed 17½ pounds. This occurrence
very naturally excited great attention. M. Biot,
under the authority of the government, repaired to
L'Aigle, collected the various facts in regard to the
phenomenon, took the depositions of witnesses, etc.,
and finally embraced the results of his investigations
in an elaborate memoir.</p>

<p>It would not comport with the design of the present
treatise to give an extended list of these phenomena.
The following account, however, includes
the most important instances of the fall of aerolites,
and also of the displays of meteoric fire-balls.</p>

<p>1. According to Livy a number of meteoric stones
fell on the Alban Hill, near Rome, about the year
654 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> This is the most ancient fall of aerolites
on record.</p>

<p>2. 468 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, about the year in which Socrates was
born. A mass of rock, described as "of the size of
two millstones," fell at Ægos Potamos, in Thrace.
An attempt to rediscover this meteoric mass, so
celebrated in antiquity, was recently made, but without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
success. Notwithstanding this failure, Humboldt
expressed the hope that, as such a body would be difficult
to destroy, it may yet be found, "since the
region in which it fell is now become so easy of
access to European travelers."</p>

<p>3. 921 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> An immense aerolite fell into the
river (a branch of the Tiber) at Narni, in Italy. It
projected three or four feet above the surface of the
water.</p>

<p>4. 1492, November 7th. An aerolite, weighing
two hundred and seventy-six pounds, fell at Ensisheim,
in Alsace, penetrating the earth to the depth
of three feet. This stone, or the greater portion of
it, may still be seen at Ensisheim.</p>

<p>5. 1511, September 14th. At noon an almost total
darkening of the heavens occurred at Crema. "During
this midnight gloom," says a writer of that
period, "unheard-of thunders, mingled with awful
lightnings, resounded through the heavens. * * *
On the plain of Crema, where never before was seen
a stone the size of an egg, there fell pieces of rock
of enormous dimensions and of immense weight. It
is said that ten of these were found weighing a hundred
pounds each." A monk was struck dead at
Crema by one of these rocky fragments. This terrific
meteoric display is said to have lasted two hours,
and 1200 aerolites were subsequently found.</p>

<p>6. 1637, November 29th. A stone, weighing fifty-four
pounds, fell on Mount Vaison, in Provence.</p>

<p>7. 1650, March 30th. A Franciscan monk was

9. 1686, July 19th. An extraordinary fire-ball
was seen in England; its motion being opposite to
that of the earth in its orbit. Halley pronounced
this meteor a cosmical body. (See Philos. Transact.,

pounds fell at Larissa, in Macedonia.</p>

<p>11. 1719, March 19th. Another great meteor was

of 69 miles. Notwithstanding its height,
however, the report was like that of a broadside, and
so great was the concussion that windows and doors
were violently shaken.</p>

<p>12. 1751, May 26th. Two meteoric masses, consisting
almost wholly of iron, fell near Agram, the
capital of Croatia. The larger fragment, which
weighs seventy-two pounds, is now in Vienna.</p>

<p>13. 1756. The concussion produced by a meteoric
explosion threw down chimneys at Aix, in Provence,
and was mistaken for an earthquake.</p>

<p>14. 1771, July 17th. A large meteor exploded
near Paris, at an elevation of 25 miles.</p>

<p>15. 1783, August 18th. A fire-ball of extraordinary
magnitude was seen in Scotland, England, and
France. It produced a rumbling sound like distant
thunder, although its elevation above the earth's
surface was 50 miles at the time of its explosion.
The velocity of its motion was equal to that of the
earth in its orbit, and its diameter, according to Sir
Charles Blagden, was about half a mile.</p>

<p>16. 1790, July 24th. Between nine and ten o'clock
at night a very large igneous meteor was seen near
Bourdeaux, France. Over Barbotan a loud explosion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
was heard, which was followed by a shower of meteoric
stones of various magnitudes.</p>

<p>17. 1794, July. A fall of about a dozen aerolites
occurred at Sienna, Tuscany.</p>

<p>18. 1795, December 13th. A large meteoric stone
fell near Wold Cottage, in Yorkshire, England.
The following account of the phenomenon is taken
from Milner's <i>Gallery of Nature</i>, p. 134: "Several
persons heard the report of an explosion in the air,
followed by a hissing sound; and afterward felt a
shock, as if a heavy body had fallen to the ground
at a little distance from them. One of these, a plowman,
saw a huge stone falling toward the earth, eight
or nine yards from the place where he stood. It threw
up the mould on every side; and after penetrating
through the soil, lodged some inches deep in solid
chalk rock. Upon being raised, the stone was found
to weigh fifty-six pounds. It fell in the afternoon of a
mild but hazy day, during which there was no thunder
or lightning; and the noise of the explosion was
heard through a considerable district."</p>

<p>19. 1796, February 19th. A stone of ten pounds'
weight fell in Portugal.</p>

<p>20. 1798, March 12th. A stone weighing twenty
pounds fell at Sules, near Ville Franche.</p>

<p>21. 1798, March 17th. An aerolite weighing about
twenty pounds fell at Sale, Department of the Rhone.</p>

<p>22. 1798, December 19th. A shower of meteoric
stones fell at Benares, in the East Indies. An interesting
account of the phenomenon was given by J.
Lloyd Williams, F.R.S., then a resident in Bengal.
The sky had been perfectly clear for several days.
At eight o'clock in the evening a large meteor appeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
which was attended with a loud rumbling
noise. Immediately after the explosion a sound was
heard like that of heavy bodies falling in the neighborhood.
Next morning the fresh earth was found
turned up in many places, and aerolites of various
sizes were discovered beneath the surface.</p>

<p>23. 1803, April 26th. The shower at L'Aigle,
previously described.</p>

<p>24. 1807, December 14th. A large meteor exploded
over Weston, Connecticut. The height,
direction, velocity, and magnitude of this body
were ably discussed by Dr. Bowditch in a memoir
communicated to the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences in 1815. The following condensed
statement of the principal facts, embodied in Dr.
Bowditch's paper, is extracted from the <i>People's
Magazine</i> for January 25th, 1834:</p>

<p>"The meteor of 1807 was observed about a quarter-past
six on Monday morning. The day had just
dawned, and there was little light except from the
moon, which was just setting. It seemed to be half
the diameter of the full moon; and passed, like a
globe of fire, across the northern margin of the sky.
It passed behind some clouds, and when it came out
it flashed like heat lightning. It had a train of
light, and appeared like a burning fire-brand carried
against the wind. It continued in sight about half a
minute, and, in about an equal space after it faded,
three loud and distinct reports, like those of a four-pounder
near at hand, were heard. Then followed
a quick succession of smaller reports, seeming like
what soldiers call a running fire. The appearance
of the meteor was as if it took three successive throes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
or leaps, and at each explosion a rushing of stones
was heard through the air, some of which struck the
ground with a heavy fall.</p>

<p>"The first fall was in the town of Huntington,
near the house of Mr. Merwin Burr. He was standing
in the road, in front of his house, when the stone
fell, and struck a rock of granite about fifty feet from
him, with a loud noise. The rock was stained a
dark-red color, and the stone was principally shivered
into very small fragments, which were thrown
around to a distance of twenty feet. The largest
piece was about the size of a goose egg, and was still
warm.</p>

<p>"The stones of the second explosion fell about
five miles distant, near Mr. William Prince's residence,
in Weston. He and his family were in bed
when they heard the explosion, and also heard a
heavy body fall to the earth. They afterward found a
hole in the earth, about twenty-five feet from the
house, like a newly dug post-hole, about one foot in
diameter, and two feet deep, in which they found a
meteoric stone buried, which weighed thirty-five
pounds. Another mass fell half a mile distant, upon
a rock, which it split in two, and was itself shivered
to pieces. Another piece, weighing thirteen
pounds, fell a half a mile to the northeast, into a
plowed field.</p>

<p>"At the last explosion, a mass of stone fell in a
field belonging to Mr. Elijah Seely, about thirty rods
from the house. This stone falling on a ledge, was
shivered to pieces. It plowed up a large portion of
the ground, and scattered the earth and stones to the
distance of fifty or a hundred feet. Some cattle that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
were near were very much frightened, and jumped
into an inclosure. It was concluded that this last
stone, before being broken, must have weighed about
two hundred pounds. These stones were all of a
similar nature, and different from any commonly
found on this globe. When first found, they were
easily reduced to powder by the fingers, but by exposure
to the air they gradually hardened."</p>

<p>25. 1859, November 15th. Between nine and ten
o'clock in the morning, an extraordinary meteor was
seen in several of the New England States, New
York, New Jersey, the District of Columbia, and
Virginia. The apparent diameter of the head was
nearly equal to that of the sun, and it had a train,
notwithstanding the bright sunshine, several degrees
in length. Its disappearance on the coast of the
Atlantic was followed by a series of the most terrific
explosions. It is believed to have descended into
the water, probably into Delaware Bay. A highly
interesting account of this meteor, by Prof. Loomis,
may be found in the <i>American Journal of Science and
Arts</i> for January, 1860.</p>

<p>26. 1860, May 1st. About twenty minutes before
one o'clock <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, a shower of meteoric stones&mdash;one
of the most extraordinary on record&mdash;fell in the S.
W. corner of Guernsey County, Ohio. Full accounts
of the phenomena are given in <i>Silliman's Journal</i>
for July, 1860, and January and July, 1861, by Professors
E.&nbsp;B. Andrews, E.&nbsp;W. Evans, J.&nbsp;L. Smith,
and D.&nbsp;W. Johnson. From these interesting papers
we learn that the course of the meteor was about 40°
west of north. Its visible track was over Washington
and Noble Counties, and the prolongation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
its projection, on the earth's surface, passes directly
through New Concord, in the S.&nbsp;E. corner of Muskingum
County. The height of the meteor, when
seen, was about 40 miles, and its path was nearly
parallel with the earth's surface. The sky, at the
time, was, for the most part, covered with clouds
over northwestern Ohio, so that if any portion of the
meteoric mass continued on its course, it was invisible.
The velocity of the meteor, in relation to the
earth's surface, was from 3 to 4 miles per second; and
hence its absolute velocity in the solar system was
from 20 to 21 miles per second. This would indicate
an orbit of considerable eccentricity.</p>

<p>"At New <span class="locked">Concord,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> Muskingum County, where
the meteoric stones fell, and in the immediate neighborhood,
there were many distinct and loud reports
heard. At New Concord there were first heard in
the sky, a little southeast of the zenith, a loud detonation,
which was compared to that of a cannon fired
at the distance of half a mile. After an interval of
ten seconds another similar report. After two or
three seconds another, and so on with diminishing
intervals. Twenty-three distinct detonations were
heard, after which the sounds became blended together
and were compared to the rattling fire of an
awkward squad of soldiers, and by others to the
roar of a railway train. These sounds, with their
reverberations, are thought to have continued for
two minutes. The last sounds seemed to come from
a point in the southeast 45° below the zenith. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
result of this cannonading was the falling of a large
number of stony meteorites upon an area of about
ten miles long by three wide. The sky was cloudy,
but some of the stones were seen first as 'black
specks,' then as 'black birds,' and finally falling to
the ground. A few were picked up within twenty
or thirty minutes. The warmest was no warmer
than if it had lain on the ground exposed to the sun's
rays. They penetrated the earth from two to three
feet. The largest stone, which weighed one hundred
and three pounds, struck the earth at the foot of a
large oak tree, and, after cutting off two roots, one
five inches in diameter, and grazing a third root, it
descended two feet ten inches into hard clay. This
stone was found resting under a root that was not
cut off. This would seemingly imply that it entered
the earth obliquely."</p>

<p>Over thirty of the stones which fell were discovered,
while doubtless many, especially of the smaller, being
deeply buried beneath the soil, entirely escaped observation.
The weight of the largest ten was four
hundred and eighteen pounds.</p>

<p>27. 1864, May 14th. Early in the evening a very
large and brilliant meteor was seen in France, from
Paris to the Spanish border. At Montauban, and
in the vicinity, loud explosions were heard, and
showers of meteoric stones fell near the villages of
Orgueil and Nohic. The principal facts in regard to
this meteor are the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">or equal to that of the earth's orbital motion. "This
example," says Prof. Newton, "affords the strongest
proof that the detonating and stone-producing meteors
are phenomena not essentially unlike."</p>

<p>The foregoing list contains but a small proportion
even of those meteoric stones the date of whose fall
is known. But besides these, other masses have
been found so closely similar in structure to aerolites
whose descent has been observed, as to leave no
doubt in regard to their origin. One of these is a
mass of iron and nickel, weighing sixteen hundred
and eighty pounds, found by the traveler Pallas, in
1749, at Abakansk, in Siberia. This immense aerolite
may be seen in the Imperial Museum at St.
Petersburg. On the plain of Otumpa, in Buenos
Ayres, is a meteoric mass 7½ feet in length, partly
buried in the ground. Its estimated weight is thirty-three
thousand six hundred pounds. A specimen of
this stone, weighing fourteen hundred pounds, has
been removed and deposited in one of the rooms of
the British Museum. A similar block, of meteoric
origin, weighing twelve or thirteen thousand pounds,
was discovered some years since in the Province of
Bahia, in Brazil.</p>

<p>Some of the inferences derived from the examination
of meteoric stones, and the consideration of
the phenomena attending their fall, are the following:</p>

<p>1. R.&nbsp;P. Greg, Esq., of Manchester, England, who
has made luminous meteors a special study, has
found that meteoric stone-falls occur with greater
frequency than usual on or about particular days. He
calls attention especially to five aerolite epochs, viz.:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
February 15th&ndash;19th; May 19th; July 26th; November
29th, and December 13th.</p>

<p>2. It is worthy of remark that no new elements
have been found in meteoric stones. Humboldt, in
his <i>Cosmos</i>, called attention to this interesting fact.
"I would ask," he remarks, "why the elementary
substances that compose one group of cosmical
bodies, or one planetary system, may not in a great
measure be identical? Why should we not adopt
this view, since we may conjecture that these planetary
bodies, like all the larger or smaller agglomerated
masses revolving round the sun, have been
thrown off from the once far more expanded solar
atmosphere, and have been formed from vaporous
rings describing their orbits round the central
body?"<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>3. But while aerolites contain no elements but
such as are found in the earth's crust, the manner in
which these elements are combined and arranged is
so peculiar that a skillful mineralogist will readily
distinguish them from terrestrial substances.</p>

<p>4. Of the eighteen or nineteen elements hitherto
observed in meteoric stones, iron is found in the
greatest abundance. The specific gravities vary from
1·94 to 7·901: the former being that of the stone of
Alais, the latter, that of the meteorite of Wayne
County, Ohio, described by Professor J.&nbsp;L. Smith in
<i>Silliman's Journal</i> for November, 1864, p. 385. In
most cases, however, the specific gravity is about 3
or 4.</p>

<p>5. The contemplation of the heavenly bodies has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
often produced in thoughtful minds an intense desire
to know something of their nature and physical constitution.
This curiosity is gratified in the examination
of aerolites. To handle, weigh, inspect, and
analyze bodies that have wandered unnumbered
ages through the planetary spaces&mdash;perhaps approaching
in their perihelia within a comparatively
short distance of the solar surface, and again receding
in their aphelia to the limits of the planetary
system&mdash;must naturally excite a train of pleasurable
emotions.</p>

<p>6. It is highly probable that in pre-historic times,
before the solar system had reached its present stage
of maturity, those chaotic wanderers were more numerous
in the vicinity of the earth's orbit than in recent
epochs. Even now the interior planets, Mercury
and Venus, appear to be moving through the masses
of matter which constitute the zodiacal light. It
would seem probable, therefore, that they are receiving
from this source much greater accretions of
matter than the earth.</p>

<p>7. As Mercury's orbit is very eccentric, he is beyond
his mean distance during much more than half
his period. Hence, probably, the greater increments
of meteoric matter are derived from such portions of
the zodiacal light as have a longer period than Mercury
himself. If so, the tendency would be to diminish
slowly the planet's mean motion. Such a
lengthening of the period has been actually <span class="locked">discovered.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span></p>
<hr />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />

<span class="subhead notbold">CONJECTURES IN REGARD TO METEORIC EPOCHS.</span></h2>

<p>It is highly probable that aerolites and shooting-stars
are derived either from rings thrown off in the
planes of the solar or planetary equators, or from
streams of nebulous matter drawn into the solar
system by the sun's attraction. Such annuli or
streams would probably each furnish an immense
number of meteor-asteroids. If any rings intersect
the earth's orbit, our planet must encounter such
masses as happen at the same time to be passing the
point of intersection. This must be repeated <i>at the
same epoch</i> in different years; the frequency of the
encounter of course depending on the closeness and
regularity with which the masses are distributed
around the ring. Accordingly it has been found
that not only the meteors of November 14th and of
the epochs named in Chapter II. have their respective
radiants, but also those of many other nights. Mr.
Alexander S. Herschel, of Collingwood, England,
states that fifty-six such points of divergence are now
well established. We have mentioned in a previous
chapter that Mr. Greg, of Manchester, has specified
several epochs at which fire-balls appear, and meteoric
stone-falls occur, with unusual frequency. The number
of these periods will probably be increased by
future observations. Perhaps the following facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
may justify the designation of July 13th&ndash;14th as
such an epoch:</p>

<p>1. On the 13th of July, 1797, a large fire-ball
was seen in Göttingen.</p>

<p>2. On the 14th of July, 1801, a fire-ball was seen
in Montgaillard.</p>

<p>3. On the 14th of July, 1845, a brilliant meteor
was seen in London.</p>

<p>4. On the 13th of July, 1846, at about 9h. and
30m. <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, a brilliant fire-ball passed over Maryland
and Pennsylvania, and was seen also in Virginia,
Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut.
Its course was north, about thirty degrees east, and
the projection of its path on the earth's surface passed
about four miles west of Lancaster, Pennsylvania,
and nearly through Mauch Chunk, in Carbon County.
When west of Philadelphia its angle of elevation, as
seen from that city, was forty-two degrees. Consequently
its altitude, when near Lancaster, was about
fifty-nine miles. The projection of its visible path,
on the earth's surface, was at least two hundred and
fifty miles in length. Its height, when nearest Gettysburg,
was about seventy miles, and it disappeared
at an elevation of about eighteen miles, near the
south corner of Wayne County, Pennsylvania. Its
apparent diameter, as seen from York and Lancaster,
was about half that of the moon, and its estimated
heliocentric velocity was between twenty and twenty-five
miles.</p>

<p>The author was assured by persons in Harford
County, Maryland, and also in York, Pennsylvania,
that shortly after the disappearance of the meteor a
distinct report, like that of a distant cannon, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
heard. As might be expected, their estimates of the
interval which elapsed were different; but Daniel M.
Ettinger, Esq., of York, who was paying particular
attention, in expectation of a report, stated that it
was a little over six minutes. This would indicate
a distance of about seventy-five miles. The sound
could not therefore have resulted from an explosion
at or near the termination of the meteor's observed
path. The inclination of the meteoric track to the
surface of the earth was such that the body could
not have passed out of the atmosphere. As no aerolites,
however, were found beneath any part of its
path, perhaps the entire mass may have been dissipated
before reaching the earth.&mdash;<i>Silliman's Journal</i>
for May, 1866.</p>

<p>5. On the 14th of July, 1847, a remarkable fall
of aerolites was witnessed at Braunau, in Bohemia.
Humboldt states that "the fallen masses of stone
were so hot, that, after six hours, they could not be
touched without causing a burn." An analysis of
some of the fragments, by Fischer and Duflos, gave
the following result:</p>

was seen at Stone-Easton, Somerset, England.</p>

<p>7. On the 13th of July, 1852, a large bolide was
seen in London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
8. On the 14th of July, 1854, a fire-ball was seen
at Senftenberg.</p>

<p>9. On the 13th of July, 1855, a meteor, three
times as large as Jupiter, was seen at Nottingham,
England.</p>

<p>10. "One of the most celebrated falls that have
occurred of late years is that which happened on the
14th of July, 1860, between two and half-past two in
the afternoon, at Dhurmsala, in India. The aerolite
in question fell with a most fearful noise, and terrified
the inhabitants of the district not a little. Several
fragments were picked up by the natives, and carried
religiously away, with the impression that they had
been thrown from the summit of the Himalayas by
an invisible Divinity. Lord Canning forwarded some
of these stones to the British Museum and to the Vienna
Museum. Mr. J.&nbsp;R. Saunders also sent some of
the stones to Europe. It appears that, soon after
their fall, the stones were <i>intensely cold</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> They are
ordinary earthy aerolites, having a specific gravity
of 3·151, containing fragments of iron and iron pyrites;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
they have an uneven texture, and a pale-gray
color."</p>

<p>11. At a quarter-past ten o'clock on the evening
of July 13th, 1864, a large fire-ball was seen in New
<span class="locked">England.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> The hour of its appearance, it will be
observed, was nearly the same with that of the bolide
of July 13th, 1846; and it is also worthy of
remark that their <i>directions</i> were nearly the same.
The meteor of 1864 had a tail three or four degrees
in length, and the body, like that of 1846, exploded
with a loud report.</p>

<p>12. On the 8th of July, 1186, an aerolite fell at
Mons, in Belgium (Quetelet's <i>Physique du Globe</i>, p.
320). A forward motion of the node, somewhat less
than that observed in the rings of November and
August, would give a correspondence of dates between
the falls of 1186, 1847, and 1860.</p>

<p>With the exception of the last, which is doubtful,
these phenomena all occurred within a period of
67 years.</p>

<h3 class="notbold"><span class="smcap">The Epoch of November 29.</span></h3>

<p>It has been stated that in different years meteoric
stones have fallen about the 29th of November. One
of the most recent aerolites which can be assigned
to this epoch is that which fell on the 30th of November,
1850, at Shalka, in Bengal. It may be
mentioned, as at least a coincidence, that the earth
passes the approximate intersection of her orbit with
that of Biela's comet at the date of this epoch. Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
other bodies besides the two Biela comets move in
the same ellipse? It is worthy of remark that two
star showers have been observed at this date: one
in China, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 930, the other in Europe, 1850 (see
Quetelet's Catalogue). It is certainly important
that the meteors of this epoch should be carefully
studied.</p>

AEROLITIC FALLS OCCUR MORE FREQUENTLY BY
DAY THAN BY NIGHT?&mdash;DO METEORITES, BOLIDES,
AND THE MATTER OF ORDINARY SHOOTING-STARS,
COEXIST IN THE SAME RINGS?</span></h2>

<p>Professor Charles Upham Shepard, of Amherst
College, who has devoted special attention to the
study of meteoric stones, has designated two districts
of country, one in each continent, but both in the
northern hemisphere, in which more than nine-tenths
of all known aerolites have fallen. He remarks:
"The fall of aerolites is confined principally to two
zones; the one belonging to America is between 33°
and 44° north latitude, and is about 25° in length.
Its direction is more or less from northeast to southwest,
following the general line of the Atlantic coast.
Of all known occurrences of this phenomenon during
the last fifty years, 92·8 per cent. have taken
place within these limits, and mostly in the neighborhood
of the sea. The zone of the Eastern continent&mdash;with
the exception that it extends ten degrees
more to the north&mdash;lies between the same degrees
of latitude, and follows a similar northeast direction,
but is more than twice the length of the American
zone. Of all the observed falls of aerolites, 90·9 per
cent. have taken place within this area, and were also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
concentrated in that half of the zone which extends
along the Atlantic."</p>

<p>The facts as stated by Professor Shepard are, of
course, unquestionable. It seems, however, extremely
improbable that the districts specified should receive
a much larger proportion of aerolites than others of
equal extent. How, then, are the facts to be accounted
for? We answer, the number of aerolites
<i>seen</i> to fall in a country depends upon the number of
its inhabitants. The ocean, deserts, and uninhabited
portions of the earth's surface afford no instances of
such phenomena, simply for the want of observers.
In sparsely settled countries the fall of aerolites
would not unfrequently escape observation; and as
such bodies generally penetrate the earth to some
depth, the chances of discovery, when the fall is not
observed, must be exceedingly rare. Now the part
of the American continent designated by Professor
Shepard, it will be noticed, is the oldest and most
thickly settled part of the United States; while that
of the Eastern continent stretches in like manner
across the most densely populated countries of Europe.
This fact alone, in all probability, affords a
sufficient explanation of Prof. Shepard's <span class="locked">statement.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span></p>

<p><i>Do aerolites fall more frequently by day than by night?</i>&mdash;Mr.
Alexander S. Herschel, of Collingwood, England,
has with much care and industry collected and
collated the known facts in regard to bolides and
aerolites. One result of his investigations is that a
much greater number of meteoric stones are observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
to fall by day than by night. From this he
infers that, for the most part, the orbits in which
they move are <i>interior</i> to that of the earth. The fact,
however, is obviously susceptible of a very different
explanation&mdash;an explanation quite similar to that of
the frequent falls in particular districts. <i>At night the
number of observers is incomparably less; and hence many
aerolites escape detection.</i> There would seem to be no
cause, reason, or antecedent probability of these falls
being more frequent at one hour than another in the
whole twenty-four.</p>

<p><i>The coexistence of meteorites, bolides, and the matter of
shooting-stars in the same rings?</i>&mdash;It has been stated
on a previous page that several aerolite epochs are
coincident with those of shooting-stars. Is the
number of such cases sufficient to justify the conclusion
that the correspondence of dates is not accidental?

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<h3>IV. The Epoch of April 18th&ndash;26th.</h3>

<p>For this epoch we have the following aerolites:</p>

<p>1. 1803, April 26th. At L'Aigle, France.</p>

<p>The foregoing lists, which might be extended, are
sufficient to establish the fact that meteoric stones
are but the largest masses in the nebulous rings from
which showers of shooting-stars are derived; a fact
worthy of consideration whatever theory may be
adopted in regard to the origin of such annuli.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />

<span class="subhead notbold">PHENOMENA SUPPOSED TO BE METEORIC&mdash;METEORIC DUST&mdash;DARK DAYS.</span></h2>

<p>It is well known that great variety has been found
in the composition of aerolites. While some are
extremely hard, others are of such a nature as to be
easily reducible to powder. It is not impossible that
when some of the latter class explode in the atmosphere
they are completely pulverized, so that, reaching
the earth in extremely minute particles, they are
never discovered. It is very unlikely, moreover,
that of the millions of shooting-stars that daily penetrate
the atmosphere nothing whatever in the solid
form should ever reach the earth's surface. Indeed,
the celebrated Reichenbach, who devoted great attention
to this subject, believed that he had actually
discovered such deposits of meteoric matter. Chladni
and others have detailed instances of the fall of <i>dust</i>,
supposed to be meteoric, from the upper regions of
the atmosphere. The following may be regarded,
with more or less probability, as instances of such
phenomena:</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 475, November 5th or 6th. A shower of
black dust fell in the vicinity of Constantinople.
Immediately before or about the time of the fall, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
to old accounts, "the heavens appeared to
be on fire," which seems to indicate a meteoric display
of an extraordinary character.</p>

<p>2. On the 3d of December, 1586, a considerable
quantity of dark-colored matter fell from the atmosphere,
at Verde, in Hanover. The fall was attended
by intense light, as well as by a loud report resembling
thunder. The substance which fell was hot
when it reached the earth, as the planks on which
a portion of it was found were slightly burnt, or
charred. The date of this occurrence, allowance
being made for the movement of the node, is
included within the limits of the meteoric epoch of
December 6th&ndash;13th.</p>

<p>3. About a century later, viz., on the 31st of January,
1686, a very extensive deposit of blackish
matter, in appearance somewhat resembling charred
paper, took place in Norway and other countries in
the north of Europe. A portion of this substance,
which had been carefully preserved, was analyzed
by Grotthus, and found to contain iron, silica, and
other elements frequently met with in aerolites.</p>

<p>4. On the 15th of November, 1755, red rain fell in
Sweden and Russia, and on the same day in Switzerland.
It gave a reddish color to the waters of Lake
Constance, to which it also imparted an acid taste.
The rain which fell on this occasion deposited a
sediment whose particles were attracted by the
magnet.</p>

<p>5. In 1791 a luminous meteor exploded over the
Atlantic Ocean, and at the same time a quantity of
matter resembling sand descended to the surface.</p>

<p>6. According to Chladni the explosion of a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
bolide over Peru, on the 27th of August, 1792, was
followed by a shower of cindery matter, the fall of
which continued during three consecutive days.</p>

<p>7. On the 13th and 14th of March, 1813, a shower
of red dust fell in Calabria, Tuscany, and Friuli.
The deposit was sufficient to impart its color to the
snow which was then upon the ground. That this
dust was meteoric can scarcely be doubted, since at
the same time a shower of aerolites fell at Cutro, in
Calabria, attended by two loud reports resembling
thunder. The shower of dust continued several
hours, and was accompanied by a noise which was
compared to the distant dashing of the waves of the
<span class="locked">ocean.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span></p>

<p>8. In November, 1819, black rain and snow fell in
Canada.</p>

<p>9. On the 3d of May, 1831, red rain fell near
Giessen. It deposited a dark-colored sediment which
Dr. Zimmermann found to contain silica, oxide of
iron, and various other substances observed in aerolites.</p>

<p>It is well known that quantities of sand are often
conveyed, by the trade-winds, from the continent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Africa and deposited in the ocean. Such sand-showers
have sometimes occurred several hundred
miles from the coast. Volcanic matter also has been
occasionally carried a considerable distance. The
phenomena above described cannot, however, be
referred to such causes; and there can be little
doubt that most, if not all of them, were of meteoric
origin.</p>

<p>There is, in all probability, a regular gradation
from the smallest visible shooting-stars to bolides
and aerolites. No doubt a great number of very
small meteoric stones penetrate beneath the earth's
surface and escape observation. An interesting account
of the accidental discovery of such <i>celestial
pebbles</i> has recently been given by Professor Haidinger,
of Vienna. The meteor from which they were
derived <i>was but little larger than an ordinary shooting-star</i>.
Its track was visible, however, until it terminated
at the earth's surface. Professor Haidinger's
account is as follows: On the 31st of July, 1859,
about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, three
inhabitants of the bourg of Montpreis, in Styria, saw
a small luminous globe, very similar to a shooting-star,
and followed by a luminous streak in the
heavens, fall directly to the earth, which it attained
close to the château that exists in the locality. The
fall was accompanied by a whistling or hissing noise
in the air, and terminated by a <i>slight</i> detonation.
The three observers, rushing to the spot where the
meteor fell, immediately found a small cavity in the
hard, sandy soil, from which they extracted three
small meteoric stones about the size of nuts, and a
quantity of black powder. For five to eight seconds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
these stones continued in a <i>state of incandescence</i>, and
it was necessary to allow upwards of a quarter of an
hour to elapse before they could be touched without
inflicting a burn. They appear to have been ordinary
meteoric stones, covered with the usual black
rind. The possessors would not give them up to be
analyzed. The details of this remarkable occurrence
of the fall of an extremely small meteor, we owe to
Herr Deschann, Conservator of the Museum of Laibach,
in Carniola, and member of the Austrian
Chamber of Deputies.</p>

<p>The following is perhaps the only instance on record
in which a shooting-star <i>lower than the clouds</i> has
been undoubtedly observed. The date is one at
which meteors are said to be more than usually
numerous; and the radiant point for the epoch has
been recently determined, by British observers, to
be about <i>Gamma Cygni</i>. The meteor was seen by
Mr. David Trowbridge, of Hector, Schuyler County,
New York, who says: "On the evening of July 26th,
1866, about 8h. 15m. <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, a very bright meteor
flashed out in Cygnus, and moved from east to west
with great rapidity. Its path was about 30° after I
saw it. Height above the northern horizon about
50°. Duration of flight from one-half to one second.
It left a beautiful train. The head was red and train
blue. It was certainly <i>below</i> the clouds. It passed
between me and some cirro-stratus clouds, so dense
as to hide ordinary stars completely. Several others
that saw it said it was <i>below</i> the clouds."&mdash;<i>Silliman's
Journal</i> for Sept. 1866. It seems altogether probable
that when a meteor thus descends, before its explosion
or dissipation, into the lower atmospheric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
strata, at least portions of its mass must reach the
earth's surface.</p>

<h3 class="notbold"><span class="smcap">Meteoric Transits&mdash;Dark Days.</span></h3>

<p>If shooting-stars and aerolites are derived from
meteoric rings revolving round the sun in orbits
nearly intersecting that of the earth, then (1) these
masses must sometimes transit the solar disk; (2) if
any of the rings contain either individual masses of
considerable magnitude, or sufficiently dense swarms
of meteoric asteroids, such transits may sometimes be
observed; (3) the passage of a dense meteoric cluster
over the solar disk must partially intercept the sun's
light and heat; and (4) should both nodes of the ring
very nearly intersect the earth's orbit, meteoric falls
might occur when the earth is at either; in which
case the epochs would be separated by an interval of
about six months. Have any such phenomena as
those indicated been actually observed?</p>

<p>The passage of dark spots across the sun, having
a much more rapid motion than the solar maculæ,
has been frequently noticed. The following instances
are well authenticated:</p>

<p>1779, June 17th. About mid-day the eminent
French astronomer, Messier, saw a great number of
black points crossing the sun. Rapidly moving spots
were also seen by Pastorff on the following dates:</p>

<p>1822, October 23d,</p>

<p>1823, July 24th and 25th,</p>

<p>1836, October 18th,</p>

<p class="in0">and on several subsequent occasions the same astronomer
witnessed similar phenomena. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
transit of this kind has been seen quite recently. On
the 8th of May, 1865, a small black spot was seen
by Coumbary to cross the solar disk. It seems difficult
to account for these appearances (so frequently
seen by experienced observers) unless we regard
them as meteoric masses.</p>

<h3 class="notbold"><span class="smcap">Partial Interception of the Sun's Light and
Heat.</span></h3>

<p>Numerous instances are on record of partial obscurations
of the sun which could not be accounted
for by any known cause. Cases of such phenomena
took place, according to Humboldt, in the years 1090,
1203, and 1547. Another so-called <i>dark day</i> occurred
on the 12th of May, 1706, and several more (some of
still later date) might be specified. Chladni and
other physicists have regarded the transit of meteoric
masses as the most probable cause of these obscurations.
It is proper to remark, however, that the
eminent French astronomer, Faye, who has given
the subject much attention, finds little or no evidence
in support of this conjecture.</p>

<p>An examination of meteorological records is said
to have established two epochs of abnormal cold, viz.,
about the 12th of February and the 12th of May.
The former was pointed out by Brandes about the
beginning of the present century; the latter by
Mädler, in 1834. The May epoch occurs when the
earth is in conjunction with one of the nodes of the
November meteoric ring; and that of February has
a similar relation to the August meteors. M. Erman,
a distinguished German scientist, soon after the discovery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
of the August and November meteoric epochs,
suggested that those depressions of temperature might
be explained by the intervention of the meteoric
zones between the earth and the sun. The period,
however, of the November meteors being still somewhat
doubtful, their position with respect to the
earth about the 12th of May is also uncertain. But
however this may be, the following dates of aerolitic
falls seem to indicate May 8th&ndash;14th, or especially
May 12th&ndash;13th, as a meteoric epoch:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) May 8th, 1829, Forsyth, Georgia, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) May 8th, 1846, Macerata, Italy.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) May 9th, 1827, Nashville, Tennessee, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) May 12th, 1861, Goruckpore, India.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) May 13th, 1831, Vouillé, France.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) May 13th, 1855, Oesel, Baltic Sea.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) May 13th, 1855, Bremevörde, Hanover.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) May 14th, 1861, near Villanova, in Catalonia,
Spain.</p>

<p>(<i>i</i>) May 14th, 1864, Orgueil, France.</p>

<p class="in0">All the foregoing, except that of May 14th, 1861,
may be found in Shepard's list, <i>Silliman's Journal</i> for
January, 1867.</p>

<p>It has been shown in a former chapter that more
than seven millions of shooting-stars of sufficient
magnitude to be seen by the naked eye daily enter
the earth's atmosphere. As the small ones are the
most numerous, it is not improbable that an indefinitely
greater number of meteoric particles, too
minute to be visible, are being constantly, in this
manner, arrested in their orbital motion. Now, it
would certainly be a very unwarranted conclusion
that these atmospheric increments are all of a permanently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
gaseous form. In view of this strong
probability that meteoric dust is daily reaching the
earth's surface, Baron von Reichenbach, of Vienna,
conceived the idea of attempting its discovery. Ascending
to the tops of some of the German mountains,
he carefully collected small quantities of the soil from
positions in which it had not been disturbed by man.
This matter, on being analyzed, was found to contain
small portions of nickel and cobalt&mdash;elements
rarely found in the mineral masses scattered over
the earth's surface, but very frequently met with in
aerolites. In short, Reichenbach believed, and certainly
not without some probability, that he had
detected minute portions of meteoric matter.</p>

<span class="subhang notbold">FURTHER RESEARCHES OF REICHENBACH&mdash;THEORY OF
METEORS&mdash;STABILITY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM&mdash;DOCTRINE
OF A RESISTING MEDIUM.</span></h2>

<p>The able and original researches of the celebrated
Reichenbach, who has made meteoric phenomena
the subject of long-continued and enthusiastic investigation,
have attracted the general attention of
scientific men. It is proposed to present, in the following
chapter, a brief <i>resumé</i> of his views and conclusions.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Constitution of Comets.</i>&mdash;It is a remarkable
fact that cometary matter has no refractive power,
as is manifest from the observations of stars seen
through their <span class="locked">substance.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> These bodies, therefore,
are not gaseous; and the most probable theory in
regard to their nature is that they consist of an infinite
number of discrete, solid molecules, at great
distances from each other, with very little attraction
among themselves, or toward the nucleus, and having,
therefore, great mobility. Now Baron Reichenbach,
having carefully examined a great number of
meteoric stones, has found them for the most part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
composed of extremely minute globules, apparently
cemented together. He hence infers that they have
been comets&mdash;perhaps very small ones&mdash;whose component
molecules have by degrees collected into
single masses.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Number of Aerolites.</i>&mdash;The average number
of aerolitic falls in a year was estimated by Schreibers,
as previously stated, at 700. Reichenbach, however,
after a thorough discussion of the data at hand, makes
the number much larger. He regards the probable
annual average, for the entire surface of the earth,
as not less than 4500. This would give about twelve
daily falls. They are of every variety as to magnitude,
from a weight of less than a single ounce to
over 30,000 pounds. The Baron even suspects the
meteoric origin of large masses of dolerite which all
former geologists had considered native to our planet.
In view of the fact that from the largest members of
our planetary system down to the particles of meteoric
dust there is an approximately regular gradation,
and that the larger, at least in some instances, appear
to have been formed by the aggregation of the
smaller, he asks may not the earth itself have been
formed by an agglomeration of meteorites? The
learned author, from the general scope of his speculations,
would thus seem to have adopted a form
of the nebular hypothesis somewhat different from
that proposed by Laplace.</p>

<p>3. <i>Composition and mean Density of Aerolites.</i>&mdash;A
large proportion of meteoric stones are similar in
structure to the volcanic or plutonic rocks of the
earth; and <i>all</i> consist of elements identical with
those in our planet's crust. Their mean density,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
moreover, is very nearly the same with that of the
earth. These facts are regarded by Reichenbach as
indicating that those meteoric masses which are
daily becoming incorporated with our planet, have
had a common origin with the earth itself. Baron
Reichenbach's views, as presented by himself, will
be found at length in <i>Poggendorf's Annalen</i> for December,
1858.</p>

<p><i>Stability of the Solar System.</i>&mdash;The well-known demonstrations
of the stability of the solar system,
given by Lagrange and Laplace, are not to be accepted
in an unlimited sense. They make no provision
against the destructive agency of a resisting
medium, or the entrance of matter into the solar
domain from the interstellar spaces. In short, the
conservative influence ascribed to these celebrated
theorems extends only to the major planets; and
even in their case it is to be understood as applying
only to their mutual perturbations. The phenomena
of shooting-stars and aerolites have demonstrated
the existence of considerable quantities of matter
moving in <i>unstable</i> orbits. The amount of such matter
within the solar system cannot now be determined;
but the term probably includes the zodiacal
light, many, if not all, of the meteoric rings, and a
large number of comets. These unstable parts of the
system are being gradually incorporated with the
sun, the earth, and doubtless also with the other
large planets. It is highly probable that at former
epochs the quantity of such matter was much greater
than at present, and that, unless new supplies be received
<i>ab extra</i>, it must, by slow degrees, disappear
from the system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
The fact, now well established, of the extensive
diffusion of meteoric matter through the interplanetary
spaces has an obvious bearing on Encke's theory
of a resisting medium. If we grant the existence of
such an ether, it would seem unphilosophical to ascribe
to it one of the properties of a material fluid&mdash;the
power of resisting the motion of all bodies moving
through it&mdash;and to deny it such properties in
other respects. Its condensation, therefore, about
the sun and other large bodies must be a necessary
consequence. This condensation existed in the
primitive solar spheroid, before the formation of the
planets: the rotation of the spheroid would be communicated
to the coexisting ether; and hence, <i>during
the entire history of the planetary system, the ether has
revolved around the sun in the same direction with the
planets</i>. This condensed ether, it is also obvious,
must participate in the progressive motion of the
solar system.</p>

<p>But again; even if we reject the doctrine of the
development of the planetary bodies from a rotating
nebula, we must still regard the density of the ether
as increasing to the center of the system. The sun's
rotation, therefore, would communicate motion to
the first and denser portions; this motion would be
transmitted outward through successive strata, with
a constantly diminishing angular velocity. The
motion of the planets themselves through the medium
in nearly circular orbits would concur in imparting
to it a revolution in the same direction.
Whether, therefore, we receive or reject the nebular
hypothesis, the resistance of the ethereal medium to
bodies moving in orbits of small eccentricity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
in the direction of the sun's rotation, becomes an
infinitesimal quantity.</p>

<p>The hypothesis of Encke, it is well known, was
based solely on the observed acceleration of the
comet which bears his name. More recently, however,
a still greater acceleration has been found in
the case of Faye's comet. Now as the meteoric
matter of the solar system is a <i>known</i> cause for such
phenomena, sufficient, in all probability, both in
mode and measure, the doctrine of a resisting ethereal
medium would seem to be a wholly unnecessary
assumption.</p>

<span class="subhang notbold">DOES THE NUMBER OF AEROLITIC FALLS VARY WITH THE
EARTH'S DISTANCE FROM THE SUN?&mdash;RELATIVE NUMBERS
OBSERVED IN THE FORENOON AND AFTERNOON&mdash;EXTENT
OF THE ATMOSPHERE AS INDICATED BY METEORS.</span></h2>

<p>An analysis of any extensive table of meteorites
and fire-balls proves that a greater number of aerolitic
falls have been observed during the months of
June and July, when the earth is near its aphelion,
than in December and January, when near its perihelion.
It is found, however, that the reverse is true
in regard to bolides, or fire-balls. Now the theory
has been held by more than one physicist, that aerolites
are the outriders of the asteroid ring between
Mars and Jupiter; their orbits having become so
eccentric that in perihelion they approach very near
that of the earth. If this theory be the true one, the
earth would probably encounter the greatest number
of those meteor-asteroids when near its aphelion.
The hypothesis therefore, it has been claimed, appears
to be supported by well-known facts. The
variation, however, in the observed number of aerolites
may be readily accounted for independently of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
any theory as to their origin. The fall of meteoric
stones would evidently be more likely to escape observation
by night than by day, by reason of the
relatively small number of observers. But the days
are shortest when the earth is in perihelion, and
longest when in aphelion; the ratio of their lengths
being nearly equal to that of the corresponding numbers
of aerolitic falls.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is obvious that fire-balls, unless
of very extraordinary magnitude, would not be
visible during the day. The <i>observed</i> number will
therefore be greatest when the nights are longest;
that is, when the earth is near its perihelion. This,
it will be found, is precisely in accordance with observation.</p>

<p>It has been found, moreover, that a greater number
of meteoric stones fall during the first half of the
day, that is, from midnight to noon, than in the latter
half, from noon to midnight. This would seem
to indicate that a large proportion of the aerolites
encountered by the earth have direct motion.</p>

<p><i>Height of the Atmosphere.</i>&mdash;The weight of a given
volume of mercury is 10,517 times that of an equal
volume of air at the earth's surface; and since the
mean height of the mercurial column in the barometer
is about thirty inches, if the atmosphere
were of uniform density its altitude would be about
26,300 feet, or nearly five miles. The density rapidly
diminishes, however, as we ascend above the
earth's surface. Calling it unity at the sea level, the
rate of variation is approximately expressed as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

</table>

<p>From this table it will be seen that at the height of
35 miles the air is one thousand times rarer than at
the surface of the earth; and that, supposing the
same rate of decrease to continue, at the height of
140 miles the rarity would be one trillion times greater.
The atmosphere, however, is not unlimited. When it
becomes so rare that the force of repulsion between
its particles is counterbalanced by the earth's attraction,
no further expansion is possible. To determine
the altitude of its superior surface is a problem at
once difficult and interesting. Not many years since
about 45 or 50 miles were generally regarded as a
probable limit. Considerable light, however, has
been thrown upon the question by recent observations
in meteoric astronomy. Several hundred detonating
meteors have been observed, and their
average height at the instant of their first appearance
has been found to exceed 90 miles. The great
meteor of February 3d, 1856, seen at Brussels, Geneva,
Paris, and elsewhere, was 150 miles high when
first seen, and a few apparently well-authenticated
instances are known of a still greater elevation. We
conclude, therefore, from the evidence afforded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
meteoric phenomena, that the height of the atmosphere
is certainly not <i>less</i> than 200 miles.</p>

<p>It might be supposed, however, that the resistance
of the air at such altitudes would not develop a
sufficient amount of heat to give meteorites their
brilliant appearance. This question has been discussed
by Joule, Thomson, Haidinger, and Reichenbach,
and may now be regarded as definitively settled.
When the velocity of a meteorite is known the
quantity of heat produced by its motion through air
of a given density is readily determined. The temperature
acquired is the equivalent of the force with
which the atmospheric molecules are met by the
moving body. This is about one degree (Fahrenheit)
for a velocity of 100 feet per second, and it
varies directly as the square of the velocity. A
velocity, therefore, of 30 miles in a second would
produce a temperature of 2,500,000°. The weight
of 5280 cubic feet of air at the earth's surface is
about 2,830,000 grains. This, consequently, is the
weight of a column 1 mile in length, and whose
base or cross section is one square foot. The weight
of a column of the same dimensions at a height of
140 miles would be about 1/350000th of a grain. Hence
the heat acquired by a meteoric mass whose cross
section is one square foot, in moving 1 mile would
be one grain raised 7-1/7 degrees, or one-fifth of a grain
2500° in 70 miles. This temperature would undoubtedly
be sufficient to render meteoric bodies
brilliantly luminous.</p>

<p>But there have been indications of an atmosphere
at an elevation of more than 500 miles. A discussion
of the best observations of the great aurora seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
throughout the United States on the 28th of August,
1859, gave 534 miles as the height of the upper limit
above the earth's surface. The aurora of September
2d, of the same year, had an elevation but little inferior,
viz., 495 miles. Now, according to the observed
rate of variation of density, at the height of
525 miles, the atmosphere would be so rare that a
sphere of it filling the orbit of Neptune would contain
less matter than 1/30th of a cubic inch of air at
the earth's surface. In other words, it would weigh
less than 1/90th of a grain. We are thus forced to the
conclusion either that the law of variation is not the
same at great heights as near the surface; or, that
beyond the limits of the atmosphere of air, there is
another of electricity, or of some other fluid.</p>

<span class="subhead notbold">THE METEORIC THEORY OF SOLAR HEAT.</span></h2>

<p>Of the various theories proposed by astronomers
to account for the origin of the sun's light and heat,
only two have at present any considerable number
of advocates. These <span class="locked">are&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>The Chemical Theory</i>; according to which the
light and heat of the sun are produced by the chemical
combination of its elements; in other words, by
an intense combustion.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Meteoric Theory</i>, which ascribes the heat of
our central luminary to the fall of meteors upon its
surface. The former is advocated with great ingenuity
by Professor Ennis in a recent work on "<i>The
Origin of the Stars, and the Causes of their Motions and
their Light</i>." It has, on the other hand, been ably
opposed by Dr. Mayer, Professor William Thomson,
and other eminent physicists. A brief examination
of its claims may not be destitute of interest.</p>

<p>If the sun's heat is produced by chemical action,
whence comes the necessary supply of fuel to support
the combustion? The quantity of solar heat radiated
into space has been determined with at least an approximation
to mathematical precision. We know
also the amount produced by the combustion of a
given quantity of coal. Now it has been found by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
calculation that if the sun were a solid globe of coal,
and a sufficient supply of oxygen were furnished to
support its combustion, the amount of heat resulting
from its consumption would be less than that actually
emitted during the last 6000 years. In short, <i>no
known</i> elements would meet the demands of the
case. But it is highly probable that the different
bodies of the solar system are composed of the same
elements. This view is sustained by the well-known
fact that meteoric stones, which have reached us
from different and distant regions of space, have
brought us no new elementary substances. The
<i>chemical</i> theory of solar heat seems thus encumbered
with difficulties well-nigh insuperable.</p>

<p>Professor Ennis' mode of obviating this objection,
though highly ingenious, is by no means conclusive.
The latest analyses of the solar spectrum indicate,
he affirms, the presence of numerous elements besides
those with which we are acquainted. Some of
these may yield by their combustion a much greater
amount of heat than the same quantity of any known
elements in the earth's crust. "Every star," he remarks,
"as far as yet known, has a different set of
fixed lines, although there are certain resemblances
between them. They lead to the conclusion that
each star has, in part at least, its peculiar modifications
of matter, called simple elements; but the
number of stars is infinite, and therefore the number
of elements must be <span class="locked">infinite."<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> He argues,
moreover, that in a globe so vast as the sun there
may be forces in operation with whose nature we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
are wholly unacquainted. This leaving of the <i>known</i>
elements as well as the <i>known</i> laws of nature for <i>unknown
possibilities</i> will hardly be satisfactory to unbiased
minds.</p>

<p>Again: that the different bodies of the universe
are composed of different elements is inferred by our
author from the following among other considerations:
"In our solar system Mercury is sixty or eighty
times more dense than one of the satellites of Jupiter,
and probably in a much greater proportion denser
than the satellites of Saturn. This indicates a wide
difference between the nature of their elements."
This statement is again repeated in a subsequent
<span class="locked">page.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> "The densities of the planets and their
satellites prove that they are composed of very different
elements. Mercury is more than sixty times,
and our earth about fifty times, more dense than the
inner moon of Jupiter. Saturn is only about one-ninth
as dense as the earth; it would float buoyantly
on water. There is a high probability that the satellites
of Saturn and Uranus are far lighter than those
of Jupiter. Between the two extremes of the attendants
of the sun, there is probably a greater difference
in density than one hundred to one; and from one
extreme to the other there are regular gradations of
small amount.</p>

<p>"The difference in constitution between the earth
and the moon is seen in their densities: that of the
moon being about half that of the earth. The
nitrogen of our globe is found only in the atmosphere,
and such substances as derive it from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
atmosphere. The moon has no appreciable atmosphere,
and therefore, in a high probability, no
nitrogen."</p>

<p>The statements here quoted were designed to
show that the physical constitution of the sun and
planets is widely different from that of the earth,
and that the combustion of <i>some</i> of the elements in
this indefinite variety may account for the origin of
solar heat. Let us examine the facts.</p>

<p>According to Laplace the mass of Jupiter's first
satellite is 0·000017328, that of Jupiter being 1. The
diameter is 2436 miles. Hence the corresponding
density is a little more than <i>one-fifth</i> of the mean
density of the earth. In other words, it is somewhat
greater than the density of water, and very nearly
equal to that of Jupiter himself. Professor Ennis'
value is therefore <span class="locked">erroneous.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> In regard to the
densities of the Saturnian and Uranian satellites
nothing is known, and conjecture is useless. In
short, Saturn has the least mean density of all the
planets, primary or secondary, so far as known.
This may be owing to the great extent of his atmospheric
envelope. The density of the moon is but
three-fifths that of the earth: it is to be borne in
mind, however, that the <i>mass</i> and <i>pressure</i> are also
much less.</p>

<p>With respect to meteorites the same author remarks
that "like the moon, they are probably satellites
of the earth; but being very small, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
liable to extraordinary perturbations, and hence
strike the earth in many directions." Here, again, his
<i>facts</i> are at fault; for (1) the observed velocities of
these bodies are inconsistent with the supposition of
their being satellites of the earth; and (2) the
amount of perturbation of such bodies does not vary
with their masses: a <i>small</i> meteorite would fall
toward the earth or any other planet with no greater
velocity than a <i>large</i> one.</p>

<h3 class="notbold"><span class="smcap">The Meteoric Theory.</span></h3>

<p>It has been shown in a previous chapter that immense
numbers of meteoric asteroids are constantly
traversing the planetary spaces&mdash;that many millions,
in fact, daily enter the earth's atmosphere. Reasons
are not wanting for supposing the numbers of these
bodies to increase with great rapidity as we approach
the center of the system. Moreover, on account of
the greater force of gravity at the sun's surface the
heat produced by their fall must be much greater
than at the surface of the earth. It has been calculated
that if one of these asteroids be arrested in
perihelion by the solar atmosphere, the quantity of
heat thus developed will be 9000 times greater than
that produced by the combustion of an equal mass
of coal. There can, therefore, be no reasonable
doubt that a <i>portion</i> of the sun's heat is produced by
the impact of meteoric matter. In considering the
probability that it is <i>chiefly</i> so generated, the following
questions naturally present themselves:</p>

<p>1. <i>What amount of matter precipitated upon the sun
would develop the quantity of heat actually emitted?</i>&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>This
question has been satisfactorily discussed by
eminent physicists, and it will be sufficient for our
purpose to give the result. According to Professor
William Thomson, of Glasgow, the present rate of
emission would be kept up by a meteoric deposit
which would form an annual stratum 60 feet in
thickness over the sun's surface.</p>

<p>2. <i>Could such an increase of the sun's magnitude be
detected by micrometrical measurement?</i>&mdash;This inquiry
is readily answered in the negative. The apparent
diameter would be augmented only one second in
17,600 years.</p>

<p>3. <i>Is there any known or visible source from which
this amount of meteoric matter may be supplied?</i>&mdash;Thomson,
Mayer, and other distinguished writers regard
the zodiacal light as the source of such meteorites.
The inner portions of this immense "tornado" must
be resisted in their motions by the solar atmosphere,
and hence precipitated upon the sun's surface.</p>

<p>4. <i>Would this increase of the sun's mass derange the
motions of the solar system?</i>&mdash;To this question Prof.
Ennis gives an affirmative answer; his first objection
to the theory under consideration being stated as
follows: "The constant accumulation of such materials,
during hundreds of millions of years, would
increase the body of the sun and its consequent
gravity so greatly as to derange the entire solar system,
by destroying the balance between the centripetal
and centrifugal forces now acting on the
<span class="locked">planets."<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> This, it must be confessed, would be a
valid objection, if the meteoric matter were supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
to be derived from the extra-planetary spaces.
As their source, however,&mdash;the zodiacal light&mdash;is
interior to the earth's orbit, it can have no application
to any planet exterior to Venus. Most probably
the greater portion of the meteoric mass is even
within the orbit of Mercury, so that the effect of its
convergence could scarcely be noticed even in the
motion of the interior planets. In pre-historic time
the zodiacal light may have extended far beyond the
earth's orbit. If so, its convergence to its present
dimensions was undoubtedly attended by an acceleration
of the earth's mean motion. We can of
course have no evidence that such a shortening of
the year has never occurred.</p>

<p>The second objection urged against the meteoric
theory by the author of "The Origin of the Stars"
is thus expressed: "As we must believe that all stars
were lighted up by the same means, so we must believe,
according to this theory, that the present interior
heat of the earth and its former melted condition
in both exterior and interior, was caused by the fall
of meteorites. But if so, they must have gradually
ceased to fall, as space became cleared of their presence,
and we would now find a thick covering of
meteorites on the earth's cooled surface. Instead of
this, we find them very rarely, and in accordance
with their present very rare falls."</p>

<p>To this it may be replied that the primitive igneous
fluidity of the earth and planets was a necessary consequence
of their condensation&mdash;a fact which has no
inconsistency with the theory in question.</p>

<p>A different <i>mechanical</i> theory of the origin of solar
heat is advocated by Professor Helmholtz in his interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
work <i>On the Interaction of Natural Forces</i>.
In regard to the sun he says: "If we adopt the very
probable view, that the remarkably small density of
so large a body is caused by its high temperature,
and may become greater in time, it may be calculated
that if the diameter of the sun were diminished
only the ten-thousandth part of its present length, by
this act a sufficient quantity of heat would be generated
to cover the total emission for 2100 years.
Such a small change besides it would be difficult to
detect by the finest astronomical <span class="locked">observations."<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span>
The same view is adopted by Dr. Joel E. Hendricks,
of Des Moines, <span class="locked">Iowa.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span></p>

<span class="subhead notbold">WILL THE METEORIC THEORY ACCOUNT FOR THE PHENOMENA OF VARIABLE AND TEMPORARY STARS?</span></h2>

<p>Having shown that meteor-asteroids are diffused
in vast quantities throughout the universe; that according
to eminent physicists the solar heat is produced
by the precipitation of such matter on the
sun's surface; and that Leverrier has found it necessary
to introduce the disturbing effect of meteoric
rings in order fully to account for the motion of
Mercury's perihelion; we now propose extending
the meteoric theory to a number of phenomena that
have hitherto received no satisfactory explanation.</p>

<h3 class="notbold"><span class="smcap">Variable and Temporary Stars.</span></h3>

<p>No theory as to the origin of the sun's light and
heat would seem to be admissible unless applicable
also to the sidereal systems. Will the meteoric
theory explain the phenomena of variable and temporary
stars?</p>

<p>"It has been remarked respecting variable stars,
that in passing through their successive phases, they
are subject to sensible irregularities, which have not
hitherto been reduced to fixed laws. In general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
they do not always attain the same maximum brightness,
their fluctuations being in some cases very
considerable. Thus, according to Argelander, the
variable star in <i>Corona Borealis</i>, which Pigott discovered
in 1795, exhibits on some occasions such
feeble changes of brightness, that it is almost impossible
to distinguish the maxima from the minima
by the naked eye; but after it has completed several
of its cycles in this manner, its fluctuations all at
once become so considerable, that in some instances
it totally disappears. It has been found, moreover,
that the light of variable stars does not increase and
diminish symmetrically on each side of the maximum,
nor are the successive intervals between the maxima
exactly equal to each other."&mdash;<i>Grant's History of Physical
Astronomy</i>, p. 541.</p>

<p>Of the numerous hypotheses hitherto proposed to
account for these phenomena we believe none can be
found to include and harmonize all the facts of observation.
The theories of Herschel and Maupertius
fail to explain the irregularity in some of the periods;
while those of Newton and Dunn afford no explanation
of the periodicity <span class="locked">itself.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> But let us suppose
that among the fixed stars some have atmospheres
of great extent, as was probably the case with the
sun at a remote epoch in its history. Let us also
suppose the existence of nebulous rings, like those
of our own system, moving in orbits so elliptical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
that in their perihelia they pass through the atmospheric
envelopes of the central stars. Such meteoric
rings of varying density, like those revolving about
the sun, would evidently produce the phenomena of
variable stars. The resisting medium through which
they pass in perihelion must gradually contract their
orbits, or, in other words, diminish the intervals between
consecutive maxima. Such a shortening of
the period is now well established in the case of
<i>Algol</i>. Again, if a ring be influenced by perturbation
the period will be variable, like that of <i>Mira
Ceti</i>. A change, moreover, in the perihelion distance
will account for the occasional increase or diminution
of the apparent magnitude at the different maxima
of the same star. But how are we to account for the
variations of brightness observed in a number of
stars where no order or periodicity in the variation
has as yet been discovered? It is easy to perceive
that either a single nebulous ring with more than
one <i>hiatus</i>, or several rings about the same star, may
produce phenomena of the character described.
Finally, if the matter of an elliptic ring should accumulate
in a single mass, so as to occupy a comparatively
small arc, its passage through perihelion
might produce the phenomenon of a so-called temporary
star.</p>

<p>Recent researches relating to nebulæ seem in some
measure confirmatory of the view here presented.
These observations have shown (1) a change of position
in some of these objects, rendering it probable
that in certain cases they are not more distant than
fixed stars visible to the naked eye; and (2) a variation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
in the brilliancy of many small stars situated in
the great nebula of Orion, and also the existence of
numerous masses of nebulous matter in the form of
tufts apparently attached to stars,&mdash;facts regarded as
indicative of a physical connection between the stars
and nebulæ.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<span class="subhead notbold">THE LUNAR AND SOLAR THEORIES OF THE ORIGIN OF AEROLITES.</span></h2>

<p>Besides the <i>cosmical</i> theory of aerolites which has
been adopted in this work, and which is now accepted
by a great majority of scientific men, at least four
others have been proposed: (1) the <i>atmospheric</i>, according
to which they are formed, like hail, in the
earth's atmosphere; (2) the <i>volcanic</i>, which regards
them as matter ejected with great force from terrestrial
volcanoes; (3) the <i>lunar</i>, which supposes
them to have been thrown from craters in the moon;
and (4) the <i>solar</i> hypothesis, according to which they
are projected by some tremendous explosive force
from the great central orb of our system. The first
and second have been universally abandoned as untenable.
The third and fourth, however, are entitled
to consideration.</p>

<h3 class="notbold"><span class="smcap">The Lunar Theory.</span></h3>

<p>The theory which regards meteoric stones as products
of eruption in lunar volcanoes was received
with favor by the celebrated Laplace: "As the
gravity at the surface of the moon," he remarks, "is
much less than at the surface of the earth, and as
this body has no atmosphere which can oppose a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
sensible resistance to the motion of projectiles, we
may conceive that a body projected with a great
force, by the explosion of a lunar volcano, may
attain and pass the limit, where the attraction of the
earth commences to predominate over that of the
moon. For this purpose it is sufficient that its initial
velocity in the direction of the vertical may be
2500 meters in a second; then in place of falling
back on the moon, it becomes a satellite of the earth,
and describes about it an orbit more or less elongated.
The direction of its primitive impulsion may
be such as to make it move directly toward the
atmosphere of the earth; or it may not attain it, till
after several and even a great number of revolutions;
for it is evident that the action of the sun,
which changes in a sensible manner the distances of
the moon from the earth, ought to produce in the
radius vector of a satellite which moves in a very
eccentric orbit, much more considerable variations,
and thus at length so diminish the perigean distance
of the satellite, as to make it penetrate our atmosphere.
This body traversing it with a very great
velocity, and experiencing a very sensible resistance,
might at length precipitate itself on the earth; the
friction of the air against its surface would be sufficient
to inflame it, and make it detonate, provided
that it contained ingredients proper to produce these
effects, and then it would present to us all those
phenomena which meteoric stones exhibit. If it was
satisfactorily proved that they are not produced by
volcanoes, or generated in our atmosphere, and that
their cause must be sought beyond it, in the regions
of the heavens, the preceding hypothesis, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
likewise explains the identity of composition observed
in meteoric stones, by an identity of origin,
will not be devoid of probability."&mdash;<i>Système du
Monde</i>, t. ii. cap. v.</p>

<p>Knowing the masses and volumes of the earth and
moon, it is easy to estimate the force of gravity at
their surfaces, the distance from each to the point of
equal attraction, and the force with which a projectile
must be thrown from the lunar surface to pass within
the sphere of the earth's influence. It has been calculated
that an initial velocity of about a mile and a
half in a second would be sufficient for this purpose&mdash;a
force not greater than that known to have been
exerted by terrestrial volcanoes. The <i>possibility</i>,
therefore, that volcanic matter from our satellite
may reach the earth's surface seems fairly admissible.</p>

<p>Since the time of Laplace, several distinguished
European astronomers have regarded the lunar hypothesis
as more or less probable. It was advocated
as recently as 1851 by the late Prof. J.&nbsp;P. Nichol, of
Glasgow. This popular and interesting writer, after
describing Tycho, a large and well-known lunar
crater, from which luminous rays or stripes radiate
over a considerable part of the moon's surface, expresses
the opinion that that immense cavity was
formed by a single tremendous explosion. "Reflecting,"
he remarks, "on the probable suddenness and
magnitude of that force, or rather of that <i>explosive</i>
energy one of whose acts we have traced, as well as
on the immense mass of matter which seems to have
been thus violently dispersed, is not the inquiry a
natural one, <i>where is that matter now</i>? It is a mass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
indeed which cannot well have wholly disappeared.
It filled a cavern 55 miles in breadth, and 17,000
feet deep&mdash;a cavern into which even now one might
cast Chimborazo and Mont Blanc, and room be left
for Teneriffe behind! Like rocks flung aloft by our
volcanoes, did this immense mass fall back in fragments
to the surface of the moon, or was the expulsive
force strong enough to give it an outward velocity
sufficient to resist the attractive power of its
parent globe? The moon, be it recollected, is very
small in <i>mass</i> compared with the earth, and her attractive
energy greatly inferior accordingly. Laplace
has even calculated that the force urging a cannon-ball,
increased to a degree quite within the limits of
what is conceivable, could effect a final separation
between our satellite and any of its component
parts. It is <i>possible</i> then, and, although not demonstrable,
very far from a chimera, that the disrupted
and expelled masses were, in the case of which we
are speaking, driven conclusively into space; but if
so, where are they now? where their new residence,
and what their functions? In the emergency to
which I refer, such fragments would necessarily
wander among the interplanetary spaces in most
irregular orbits, and chiefly in the neighborhood of
the moon and the earth. Now, while the planetary
orbits are so nicely adjusted that neither confusion
nor interference can ever occur, it is not at all likely
that the same order could be established here; nay,
it is next to certain, that in the course of its orbital
revolution our globe would ever and anon come in
contact with these lunar fragments; in other words,
<span class="smcap smaller">STONES</span> <i>would fall occasionally to its surface, and apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
from its atmosphere</i>."&mdash;<i>Planetary System</i>, pp.
301, 302.</p>

<p>We have preferred to give the views of these
eminent scientists in their own language. Olbers,
Biot, and Poisson, who adopted the same theory,
estimated the <i>initial</i> velocity which would be necessary
in order that lunar fragments might pass the
point of equal attraction, and also the <i>final</i>, or acquired
velocity on reaching the earth's surface. The
several determinations of the former were as follows:</p>

<table class="narrow" summary="Height of atmosphere">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">According to Olbers</td>
    <td class="tdl">1·570 miles a second.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">According to Biot</td>
    <td class="tdl">1·569 miles a second.</td></tr>

  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">According to Poisson</td>
    <td class="tdl">1·437 miles a second.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The mean being almost exactly a mile and a half.
The velocity on reaching our planet, according to
Olbers, would be about six and a half miles. At the
date of these calculations, however, the true velocity
of aerolites had not been in any case satisfactorily
determined. Since that time it has been found in
numerous instances to exceed <i>twenty miles a second</i>&mdash;a
velocity greater than that of the earth's orbital
motion. This fact of itself would seem fatal to the
theory of a lunar origin.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, in 1859, Dr. B.&nbsp;A.
Gould read a paper on the supposed lunar origin of
aerolites, in which the hypothesis was subjected to
the test of a rigid mathematical analysis. We will
not attempt even an abstract of this interesting
memoir. It amounts, however, to a virtual disproof
of the lunar hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<h3 class="notbold"><span class="smcap">The Solar Theory.</span></h3>

<p>The theory which ascribes a solar origin to meteorites
is not of recent date, having been held by
Diogenes Laertius and other ancient Greeks. Among
the moderns its advocates have been much less numerous
than those of the lunar hypothesis. The late
Professor Charles W. Hackley, of New York, regarded
shooting-stars, aerolites, and even comets, as
matter projected with enormous force from the solar
surface. The corona seen during total eclipses of
the sun he supposed to be the emanations of this
matter through the intervals of the luculi.&mdash;(See the
Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, Fourteenth Meeting, 1860.)
An ingenious theory, differing in its details from
that of Professor Hackley, though somewhat similar
in its general features, has lately been advocated
by Alexander Wilcocks, M.D., of Philadelphia, in a
memoir read before the American Philosophical
Society, May 20th, 1864, and published in their Proceedings.
In regard to this hypothesis it seems sufficient
to remark that it fails to give a satisfactory
account of the annual periodicity of meteoric phenomena.</p>

<span class="subhead notbold">THE RINGS OF SATURN.</span></h2>

<p>Until about the middle of the present century the
rings of Saturn were universally regarded as solid
and continuous. The labors, however, of Professors
Bond and Pierce, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, as
well as the more recent investigations of Prof. Maxwell,
of England, have shown this hypothesis to be
wholly untenable. The most probable opinion, based
on the researches of these astronomers, is, that they
consist of streams or clouds of meteoric asteroids.
The zodiacal light and the zone of small planets between
Mars and Jupiter appear to constitute analogous
<i>primary</i> rings. In the latter, however, a large
proportion of the primitive matter seems to have
collected in distinct, segregated masses. These
meteoric zones have probably presented&mdash;what are
not elsewhere found in the solar system&mdash;cases of
commensurability in the planetary periods. The
interior satellites of Saturn are so near the ring as
doubtless to exert great perturbative influence. Unfortunately,
the elements of the Saturnian system as
determined by different astronomers are somewhat
discordant. This, however, is by no means surprising
when we consider the great distance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
planet and the small magnitude of some of the satellites.
For convenience of reference the mean apparent
distances of the satellites, together with their
periodic times, are given in the following table. The
former are taken from Hind's <i>Solar System</i>; the latter

<p>The interval, therefore, occupies precisely the space
in which the periods would be commensurable with
those of the four members of the system immediately
exterior. Particles occupying this portion of the
<i>primitive</i> ring would always come into conjunction
with one of these satellites in the same parts of their
orbits. Such orbits would become more and more
eccentric until the matter moving in them would
unite near one of the apsides with other portions
of the ring. <i>We have thus a physical cause for the existence
of this remarkable interval.</i></p>

<p>1. The first two members of the group, Flora and
Ariadne, have very nearly the same mean distance.
Immediately exterior to these, however, occurs a
wide interval, including the distance at which seven
periods of an asteroid would be equal to two of
Jupiter.</p>

<p>2. On the <i>outer</i> limit of the ring Freia, Cybele, and
Sylvia have also nearly equal distances, and are separated
from the next interior member by a wide
space including the distance at which two periods
would be equal to one of Jupiter, and also that at
which five would be equal to one of Saturn.</p>

<p>3. Besides these extreme members of the group,
our table contains eighty-six minor planets, all of
which are included between the distances 2·26 and
3·16; the mean interval between them being 0·0105.
The distances are distributed as follows:</p>

<p class="in0">and these, it will be observed, are the three remaining
distances, indicated on a previous page, at which
the periods of the primitive meteoric asteroids would
be commensurable with that of Jupiter. Now, if
the original ring consisted of an indefinite number
of separate particles moving with different velocities,
according to their respective distances, those revolving
at the distance 2·4935&mdash;in the interval between
Thetis and Hestia&mdash;would make precisely three revolutions
while Jupiter completes one. A planetary
particle at this distance would therefore always come
in conjunction with Jupiter in the same parts of its
path: consequently its orbit would become more
and more eccentric until the particle itself would
unite with others, either exterior or interior, thus
forming an asteroidal nucleus, while the primitive
orbit of the particle would be left destitute of matter,
like the interval in Saturn's ring.</p>

<p>5. If the distribution of matter in the zone was
originally nearly continuous, as in the case of Saturn's
rings, it would probably break up into a number of
concentric annuli. On account, however, of the
great perturbations to which they were subject, these
narrow rings would frequently come in collision.
After their rupture, and while the fragments were
collecting in the form of asteroids, numerous intersections
of orbits and new combinations of matter
would occur, so as to leave, in the present orbits,
but few traces of the rings from which the existing
asteroids were derived. A comparison, however, of
the elements of Clytie and Frigga shows a striking
similarity; and Professor Lespiault has pointed out
a corresponding likeness between the orbits of Fides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
and Maia. For these four asteroids the nodal lines and
also the inclinations are nearly the same; while the
periods differ by only a few days. It is probable,
therefore, that they are all fragments of the same
narrow ring. Finally, as they all move nearly in the
same plane, they must at some future time approach
extremely near each other, and perhaps become
united in one large asteroid.</p>

<span class="subhead notbold">ORIGIN OF METEORS&mdash;THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS.</span></h2>

<p>In regard to the physical history of those meteoric
masses which, in such infinite numbers, traverse the
interplanetary spaces, our knowledge is exceedingly
limited. Such as have reached the earth's surface
consist of various elements in a state of combination.
It has been remarked, however, by a distinguished
<span class="locked">scientist<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> that "the character of the constituent
particles of meteorites, and their general microscopical
structure, differ so much from what is seen in
terrestrial volcanic rocks, that it appears extremely
improbable that they were ever portions of the moon,
or of a planet, which differed from a large meteorite
in having been the seat of a more or less modified
volcanic action." As the celebrated nebular hypothesis
seems to afford a very probable explanation of
the origin of those bodies, whether in the form of
rings or sporadic masses, its brief consideration may
not be destitute of interest. We will merely premise
that the existence of true nebulæ in the heavens&mdash;that
is, of matter consisting of luminous gas&mdash;has
been placed beyond doubt by the revelations of the
spectroscope.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>
<p>As a group, our solar system is comparatively
isolated in space; the distance of the nearest fixed
star being at least seven thousand times that of
Neptune, the most remote known planet. Besides
the central or controlling orb, it contains, so far as
known at present, ninety-nine primary planets,
eighteen satellites, three planetary rings, and nearly
eight hundred comets. In taking the most cursory
view of this system we cannot fail to notice the following
interesting facts in regard to the motions of
its various members:</p>

<p>1. The sun rotates on his axis from west to east.</p>

<p>2. The primary planets all move nearly in the
plane of the sun's equator.</p>

<p>3. The orbital motions of all the planets, primary
and secondary, except the satellites of Uranus and
Neptune, are in the same <i>direction</i> with the sun's
rotation.</p>

<p>4. The direction of the rotary motions of all the
planets, primary and secondary, in so far as has been
observed, is identical with that of their orbital revolutions;
viz., from west to east.</p>

<p>5. The rings of Saturn revolve about the planet
in the same direction.</p>

<p>6. The planetary orbits are all nearly circular.</p>

<p>7. The <i>cometary</i> is distinguished from the <i>planetary</i>
portion of the system by several striking characteristics:
the orbits of comets are very eccentric and
inclined to each other, and to the ecliptic at all possible
angles. The motions of a large proportion of
comets are <i>from east to west</i>. The physical constitution
of the latter class of bodies is also very different
from that of the former; the matter of which comets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
are composed being so exceedingly attenuated, at
least in some instances, that fixed stars have been
distinctly visible through what appeared to be the
densest portion of their substance.</p>

<p>None of these facts are accounted for by the law
of gravitation. The sun's attraction can have no influence
whatever in determining either the <i>direction</i>
of a planet's motion, or the eccentricity of its orbit.
In other words, this power would sustain a planetary
body moving from east to west, as well as from west
to east; in an orbit having any possible degree of
inclination to the plane of the sun's equator, no less
than in one coincident with it; or, in a very eccentric
ellipse, as well as in one differing but little from
a circle. The consideration of the coincidences
which we have enumerated led Laplace to conclude
that their explanation must be referred to the <i>mode</i>
of our system's formation&mdash;a conclusion which he
regarded as strongly confirmed by the contemporary
researches of Sir William Herschel. Of the numerous
nebulæ discovered and described by that eminent
observer, a large proportion could not, even by
his powerful telescope, be resolved into stars. In
regard to many of these, it was not doubted that
glasses of superior power would show them to be
extremely remote sidereal clusters. On the other
hand, a considerable number were examined which
gave no indications of resolvability. These were
supposed to consist of self-luminous, nebulous matter&mdash;the
chaotic elements of future stars. The great
number of these irresolvable nebulæ scattered over
the heavens and apparently indicating the various
stages of central condensation, very naturally suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the idea that the solar system, and perhaps
every other system in the universe, originally existed
in a similar state. The sun was supposed by Laplace
to have been an exceedingly diffused, rotating nebula,
of spherical or spheroidal form, extending beyond
the orbit of the most distant planet; the planets
as yet having no separate existence. This immense
sphere of vapor, in consequence of the radiation of
heat and the continual action of gravity, became
gradually more dense, which condensation was necessarily
attended by an increased angular velocity
of rotation. At length a point was thus reached
where the centrifugal force of the equatorial parts
was equal to the central attraction. The condensation
of the interior meanwhile continuing, the equatorial
zone was detached, but necessarily continued
to revolve around the central mass with the same
velocity that it had at the epoch of its separation. If
perfectly uniform throughout its entire circumference,
which would be highly improbable, it would
continue its motion in an unbroken ring, like
that of Saturn; if not, it would probably collect
into several masses, having orbits nearly identical.
"These masses should assume a spheroidal form,
with a rotary motion in the direction of that of their
revolution, because their inferior articles have a less
real velocity than the superior; they have therefore
constituted so many planets in a state of vapor. But
if one of them was sufficiently powerful to unite
successively by its attraction all the others about its
center, the ring of vapors would be changed into
one spheroidal mass, circulating about the sun, with
a motion of rotation in the same direction with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
of <span class="locked">revolution."<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> Such, according to the theory of
Laplace, is the history of the formation of the most
remote planet of our system. That of every other,
both primary and secondary, would be precisely
similar.</p>

<p>In support of the nebular hypothesis, of which the
foregoing is a brief general statement, we remark
that <i>it furnishes a very simple explanation of the motions
and arrangements of the planetary system</i>. In the first
place, it is evident that the separation of a ring would
take place at the equator of the revolving mass, where
of course the centrifugal force would be greatest.
These concentric rings&mdash;and consequently the resulting
planets&mdash;would all revolve <i>in nearly the same plane</i>.
It is evident also that the central body must have a
revolution on its axis <i>in the same direction with the progressive
motion of the planets</i>. Again: at the breaking
up of a ring, the particles of nebulous matter more
distant from the sun would have a greater absolute
velocity than those nearer to it, which would produce
the observed <i>unity of direction in the rotary and
orbital revolutions</i>. The motions of the satellites are
explained in like manner. The hypothesis, moreover,
accounts satisfactorily for the fact that the orbits
of the planets are all nearly circular. And finally,
it presents an obvious explanation of the rings of
Saturn. It would almost seem, indeed, as if these
wonderful annuli had been left by the Architect of
Nature, as an index to the creative process.</p>

<p>The argument derived from the motions of the
various members of the solar system is not new,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
having been forcibly stated by Laplace, Pontécoulant,
Nichol, and other astronomers. Its full weight
and importance, however, have not, we think, been
duly appreciated. That a common physical cause
has determined these motions, must be admitted by
every philosophic mind. But apart from the nebular
hypothesis, no such cause, adequate both in
mode and measure, has ever been suggested;&mdash;indeed
none, it seems to us, is conceivable. The phenomena
which we have enumerated <i>demand</i> an explanation,
and this demand is met by the nebular
hypothesis. It will be found, therefore, when closely
examined, that the evidence afforded by the celestial
motions is sufficient to give the theory of Laplace a
very high degree of probability.</p>

<p>A comparison of the facts known in regard to
comets, falling-stars, and meteoric stones, seems to
warrant the inference that they are bodies of the
same nature, and perhaps of similar origin; differing
from each other mainly in the accidents of magnitude
and density. The hypothesis of Laplace very
obviously accounts for the formation of planets and
satellites, moving in the same direction, and in orbits
nearly circular; but how, it may be asked, can the
same theory explain the extremely eccentric, and in
some cases retrograde, motions of comets and aerolites?
This is the question to which we now direct
our attention.</p>

<p>After the nuclei of the solar and sidereal systems
had been established in the primitive nebula, and
when, in consequence, immense gaseous spheroids
had collected around such nuclei, we may suppose
that about the points of equal attraction between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
the sun and neighboring systems, portions of nebulous
matter would be left in equilibrio. Such outstanding
nebulosities would gradually contract
through the operation of gravity; and if, as would
sometimes be the case, the solar attraction should
preponderate, they would commence falling toward
our system. Unless disturbed by the planets they
would probably move round the sun in parabolas.
Should they pass, however, near any of the large
bodies of the system, their orbits might be changed
into ellipses by planetary perturbation. Such was
the view of Laplace in regard to the origin of
comets.</p>

<p>It seems probable, however, that many of these
bodies originated <i>within</i> the solar system, and belong
properly to it. The outer rings thrown off by the
planets may have been at too great distances from
the primaries to form stable satellites. Such masses
would be separated by perturbation from their
respective primaries, and would revolve round the
sun in independent orbits. Again: small portions
of nebulous matter may have been abandoned as
primary rings, at various intervals between the
planetary orbits. At particular distances such rings
would be liable to extraordinary perturbations, in
consequence of which their orbits would ultimately
assume an extremely elliptical form, like those of
comets, and perhaps also those of meteors. It was
shown in Chapter XIII. that several such regions
occur in the asteroid zone between Mars and Jupiter.
We may add, in confirmation of this view,
that there are twelve known comets whose periods
are included between those of Flora and Jupiter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Their motions are all direct; their orbits are less
eccentric than those of other comets; and the mean
of their inclinations is about the same as that of the
asteroids. These facts certainly appear to indicate
some original connection between these bodies and
the zone of minor planets.</p>

<p>The nebular hypothesis, it is thus seen, accounts
satisfactorily for the origin of comets, aerolites,
fire-balls, shooting-stars, and meteoric rings; regarding
them all as bodies of the same nature, moving
in cometary orbits about the sun. In this theory,
the zodiacal light is an immense swarm of meteor-asteroids;
so that the meteoric theory of solar heat,
explained in a previous chapter, finds its place as a
part of the same hypothesis.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</a></h2>

<p>Some of the prominent results of observation and
research in meteoric astronomy may be summed up
as follows:</p>

<p>1. The shooting-stars of November, August, and
other less noted epochs, are derived from elliptic
rings of meteoric matter which intersect the earth's
orbit.</p>

<p>2. Meteoric stones and the matter of shooting-stars
coexist in the same rings; the former being merely
collections or aggregations of the latter.</p>

<p>3. The most probable period of the November
meteors is thirty-three years and three months.
Leverrier's elements of this ring agree so closely
with Oppolzer's elements of the comet of 1866 as
to render it probable that the latter is merely <i>a large
meteor</i> belonging to the same annulus.</p>

<p>4. The spectroscopic examination of this comet
(of 1866) by William Huggins, F.R.S., indicated
that the nucleus was self-luminous, that the coma
was rendered visible by reflecting solar light, and
that "the material of the comet was similar to the
matter of which the gaseous nebulæ consist."</p>

<p>5. The time of revolution of the August meteors
is believed to be about 105 years. M. Schiaparelli
has found a striking similarity between the elements
of this ring and those of the third comet of 1862.
The same distinguished astronomer has shown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
moreover, that a nebulous mass of considerable extent,
drawn into the solar system <i>ab extra</i>, would
form a <i>ring</i> or <i>stream</i>.</p>

<p>6. The aerolitic epochs, established with more or
less certainty, are the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="in0">
<span class="digit">1. February 15th&ndash;19th.</span><br />
<span class="digit">2. March 12th&ndash;15th.</span><br />
<span class="digit">3. April 10th&ndash;12th.</span><br />
<span class="digit">4. April 18th&ndash;26th.</span><br />
<span class="digit">5. May 8th&ndash;14th; or especially, 12th&ndash;13th.</span><br />
<span class="digit">6. May 19th.</span><br />
<span class="digit">7. July 13th&ndash;14th.</span><br />
<span class="digit">8. July 26th.</span><br />
<span class="digit">9. August 7th&ndash;11th.</span><br />
10. October 13th&ndash;14th.<br />
11. November 11th&ndash;14th.<br />
12. November 27th&ndash;30th.<br />
13. December 7th&ndash;13th.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>About one-half of this number are also known as
shooting-star epochs.</p>

<p>7. The epoch of November 27th&ndash;30th corresponds
with that of the earth's crossing the orbit of Biela's
two comets. The aerolites of this epoch may therefore
have been moving in nearly the same path.</p>

<p>8. A greater number of aerolitic falls are <span class="locked">observed&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="in0">
1. By day than by night.<br />
2. In the afternoon than in the forenoon.<br />
3. When the earth is in aphelion than when in perihelion.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first fact is accounted for by the difference in
the number of observers; the second indicates that a
majority of aerolites have direct motion; and the
third is dependent on the relative lengths of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
day and night in the aphelic and perihelic portions
of the orbit.</p>

<p>9. The observed velocities of meteorites are incompatible
with the theory of their lunar origin.</p>

<p>10. If the meteoric swarm of November 14th has
a period of thirty-three years, Biela's comet passed
very <i>near</i>, if not actually <i>through</i> it toward the close
of 1845, about the time of the comet's separation.
Was the division of the cometary mass produced by
the encounter?</p>

<p>11. The rings of Saturn may be regarded as dense
meteoric masses, and the principal or permanent
division accounted for by the disturbing influence
of the interior satellites.</p>

<p>12. The asteroidal space between Mars and Jupiter
is probably a wide meteoric ring in which the largest
aggregations are visible as minor planets. In the
distribution of the mean distances of the known
members of the group a clustering tendency is quite
obvious.</p>

<p>13. The meteoric masses encountered by Encke's
comet may account for the shortening of the period
of the latter without the hypothesis of an ethereal
medium.</p>

<h3>A.<br />

<span class="subhead">The Meteors of November 14th.</span></h3>

<p>The <i>American Journal of Science and Arts</i> for May,
1867 (received by the author after the first chapters of this
work had gone to press), contains an interesting article by
Professor Newton "On certain recent contributions to Astro-Meteorology."
Of the five possible periods of the November
ring, first designated by Professor N, it is now granted
that the longest, viz., 33¼ years, is most probably the true
one. The results of Leverrier's researches in regard to the
epoch at which this meteoric mass was introduced into the
solar system, are given in the same article. This distinguished
astronomer supposes the group of meteors to have
been thrown into an elliptic orbit by the disturbing influence
of Uranus. The meteoric stream, according to the
most trustworthy elements of its orbit, passed extremely
near that planet about the year 126 of our era; which date
is therefore assigned by Leverrier as the probable time of
its entrance into the planetary system. This result, however,
requires confirmation.</p>

<p>Although the earliest display of the November meteors,
so far as certainly known, was that of the year 902, several
more ancient exhibitions may, with some probability, be
referred to the same epoch. These are the phenomena of
532, 599, and 600, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>, and 1768, <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> (See Quetelet's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Catalogue.) The time of the year at which these showers
occurred is not given. The <i>years</i>, however, correspond
very well with the epochs of the maximum display of the
November meteors. The intervals arranged in consecutive
order, are as follows:</p>

<p>This group or stream has its perihelion at the orbit of
the earth; its aphelion, at that of Uranus. (See diagram,
p. 24.) It must therefore produce star-showers at the latter
as well as at the former. Our planet, moreover, at each
encounter appropriates a portion of the meteoric matter;
while at the remote apsis of the stream Uranus in all probability
does the same. The matter of the ring will thus by
slow degrees be gathered up by the two planets.</p>

<span class="subhead">Comets and Meteors.</span></h3>

<p>The recent researches and speculations of European astronomers
in regard to the origin of comets and of meteoric
streams, have suggested to the author the propriety of reproducing
the following extracts from an article written by
himself, in July, 1861, and published in the <i>Danville Quarterly
Review</i> for December of that year:</p>

<p>"Different views are entertained by astronomers in regard
to the <i>origin</i> of comets; some believing them to enter the
solar system <i>ab extra</i>; others supposing them to have
originated within its limits. The former is the hypothesis
of Laplace, and is regarded with favor by many eminent
astronomers. It seems to afford a plausible explanation of
the paucity of large comets during certain long intervals of
time. In one hundred and fifty years, from 1600 to 1750,
sixteen comets were visible to the naked eye; of which
eight appeared in the twenty-five years from 1664 to 1689.
Again, during sixty years from 1750 to 1810, only five
comets were visible to the naked eye, while in the next fifty
years there were double that number. Now, according to
Laplace's hypothesis, patches of nebulous matter have been
left nearly in equilibrium in the interstellar spaces. As the
sun, in his progressive motion, approaches such clusters,
they must, by virtue of his attraction, move toward the
center of our system; the nearer portions with greater
velocity than the more remote. The nebulous fragments
thus introduced into our system would constitute comets;
those of the same cluster would enter the solar domain at
periods not very distant from each other; the forms of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
orbits depending upon their original relative positions with
reference to the sun's course, and also on planetary perturbations.
On the other hand, the passage of the system
through a region of space destitute of this chaotic vapor
would be followed by a corresponding paucity of comets.</p>

<p>"Before the invention of the telescope, the appearance of
a comet was a comparatively rare occurrence. The whole
number visible to the naked eye during the last three hundred
and sixty years has been fifty-five; or a mean of fifteen
per century. The recent rate of telescopic discovery, however,
has been about four or five annually. As many of
these are extremely faint, it seems probable that an indefinite
number, too small for detection, may be constantly
traversing the solar domain. If we adopt Laplace's hypothesis
of the origin of comets, we may suppose an almost
continuous fall of primitive nebular matter toward the center
of the system&mdash;the <i>drops</i> of which, penetrating the
earth's atmosphere, produce <i>sporadic</i> meteors; the larger
aggregations forming comets. The disturbing influence of
the planets may have transformed the original orbits of
many of the former, as well as of the latter, into ellipses.
It is an interesting fact that the motions of some luminous
meteors&mdash;or <i>cometoids</i>, as perhaps they might be called&mdash;have
been decidedly indicative of an origin beyond the
limits of the planetary system.</p>

<p>"But how are the phenomena of <i>periodic</i> meteors to be
accounted for, in accordance with this theory?</p>

<p>"The division of Biela's comet into two distinct parts
suggests several interesting questions in cometary physics.
The nature of the separating force remains to be discovered;
'but it is impossible to doubt that it arose from the divellent
action of the sun, whatever may have been the mode of
operation.'</p>

<p>"'A signal manifestation of the influence of the sun,' says
a distinguished writer, 'is sometimes afforded by the breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
up of a comet into two or more separate parts, on the
occasion of its approach to the perihelion. Seneca relates
that Ephoras, an ancient Greek author, makes mention of a
comet which before vanishing was seen to divide itself into
two distinct bodies. The Roman philosopher appears to
doubt the possibility of such a fact; but Keppler, with
characteristic sagacity, has remarked that its actual occurrence
was exceedingly probable. The latter astronomer
further remarked that there were some grounds for supposing
that two comets, which appeared in the same region of
the heavens in the year 1618, were the fragments of a comet
that had experienced a similar dissolution. Hevelius states
that Cysatus perceived in the head of the great comet of
1618 unequivocal symptoms of a breaking up of the body
into distinct fragments. The comet when first seen in the
month of November, appeared like a round mass of concentrated
light. On the 8th of December it seemed to be
divided into several parts. On the 20th of the same month
it resembled a multitude of small stars. Hevelius states
that he himself witnessed a similar appearance in the head
of the comet of <span class="locked">1661.'<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> Edward Biot, moreover, in his
researches among the Chinese records, found an account of
'three dome-formed comets' that were visible simultaneously
in 896, and pursued very nearly the same apparent
path.</p>

<p>"Another instance of a similar phenomenon is recorded
by Dion Cassius, who states that a comet which appeared
eleven years before our era, separated itself into several
small comets.</p>

<p>"These various examples are presented at one view, as
follows:</p>

<p class="hang2">"I. Ancient bipartition of a comet.&mdash;<i>Seneca, Quæst. Nat.</i>,
<i>lib. VII. cap. XVI.</i></p>

<p class="hang2">"II. Separation of a comet into a number of fragments,
11 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>&mdash;<i>Dion Cassius.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p class="hang2">"III. Three comets seen simultaneously pursuing the
same orbit, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 896&mdash;<i>Chinese records&mdash;Comptes
Rendus</i>, tom. xx. 1845, p. 334.</p>

<p class="hang2">"IV. Probable separation of a comet into parts, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>
1618.&mdash;<i>Hevelius</i>, <i>Cometographia</i>, p. 341.&mdash;<i>Keppler</i>,
<i>De Cometis</i>, p. 50.</p>

<p class="hang2">"V. Indications of separation, 1661.&mdash;<i>Hevelius</i>, <i>Cometographia</i>,
p. 417.</p>

<p class="hang2">"VI. Bipartition of Biela's comet, 1845&ndash;6.</p>

<p>"In view of these facts it seems highly probable, if not
absolutely certain, that the process of division has taken
place in several instances besides that of Biela's comet.
May not the force, whatever it is, that has produced <i>one</i>
separation, again divide the parts? And may not this
action continue until the fragments become invisible? According
to the theory now generally received, the periodic
phenomena of shooting-stars are produced by the intersections
of the orbits of such nebulous bodies with the earth's
annual path. Now there is reason to believe that these
meteoric rings are very elliptical, and in this respect wholly
dissimilar to the rings of primitive vapor which, according
to the nebular hypothesis, were successively abandoned at
the solar equator; in other words, that the matter of which
they are composed moves in <i>cometary</i> rather than <i>planetary</i>
orbits. May not our periodic meteors be the <i>debris</i> of ancient
but now disintegrated comets, whose matter has
become distributed around their orbits?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<h3>C.<br />

<span class="subhead">Biela's Comet and the Meteors of November 27th&ndash;30th.</span></h3>

<p>At the close of Chapter IV. it was suggested that the
meteors of November 27th&ndash;30th might possibly be derived
from a ring of meteoric matter moving in the orbit of Biela's
comet. Since that chapter was written similar conjectures
have been started in the <i>Astronomische Nachrichten</i><a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> by
Dr. Edmund Weiss and Prof. d'Arrest. The latter attempts
to show that the December meteors may be derived from
the same ring. The question will doubtless be decided at
no distant day.</p>

<h3>D.<br />

<span class="subhead">The First Comet of 1861 and the Meteors of April 20th.</span></h3>

<p>Recent investigations render it probable that the orbit of
the first comet of 1861 is identical with that of the meteors
of April 20th. The orbit is nearly perpendicular to the
ecliptic.</p>

On the other hand, five or six meteorites, on the epoch of the 13th&ndash;14th
of October, belong to a date when star-showers, so far as is at
present known, do not make their appearance." The inaccuracy of
the former statement is sufficiently apparent. In regard to the latter
